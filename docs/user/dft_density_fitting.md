# Density-fitted DFT energy and force interface

`Calculator(method="pbe-rks", device="cuda", density_fitting="auto",
auxiliary_basis="def2-svp")` selects the shared native DF Coulomb provider for
KS calculations. `auto` follows the calculation backend; explicit
`cpu`/`cuda` DF selections must match `device`. Omitting the auxiliary basis
uses the orbital basis as the auxiliary basis, as in the existing HF interface;
choose an appropriate fitting basis for scientific production calculations.

CPU and CUDA support local/semilocal RKS/UKS density-fitted energies and
analytic forces. Full-range global hybrids use matching DF-JK on both backends;
the CUDA path reuses the prepared fitted J/K provider and its occupied-RI-K
trajectory optimization. FP64 range-separated energies may use a mixed
composition: the ordinary full-range J/K primary is density fitted, while the
omega-dependent long-range exchange correction remains an exact Direct
provider. CUDA orders the independent provider streams with device events; it
does not add a successful-path host fence. WB97M-V energy composes this mixed
J/K owner with the existing self-consistent VV10 path.

This mixed composition is not range-separated RI-K: there are still no
omega-dependent DF metric/three-center integrals. Analytic forces for
range-separated or nonlocal DF compositions therefore remain rejected; so do
ECP DF and automatic mixed precision. Full-range DF forces continue to
differentiate the same auxiliary basis and Coulomb metric used by the energy,
including auxiliary-center and metric response. This interface does not change
the selected functional or grid.

```python
from generativeqc import Calculator

calc = Calculator(method="pbe-rks", basis="sto-3g", device="cuda",
                  density_fitting="auto", auxiliary_basis="def2-svp")
result = calc.singlepoint([("H", (0, 0, -0.7)), ("H", (0, 0, 0.7))],
                          properties=("energy", "forces"))
```

The prepared owner copies auxiliary shells before the public descriptor is
released. Batch geometry changes rebind both orbital and auxiliary centers.
CUDA iterations enqueue DF J and XC on the DF owner's stream, retaining density
and Fock matrices on the device; no CPU integral/reference retry is selected.
The ordinary host-controlled KS convergence loop is used for DF. The opt-in
multi-iteration direct-J solver region remains restricted to direct J.

`density_fitting_relative_threshold` controls metric rank selection.
`density_fitting_memory_budget_bytes` bounds the native CUDA DF provider's
explicit source/value storage through its existing bounded tile planner; it
is not a cap on the full KS calculation. Infeasible budgets fail explicitly.
Prepared CUDA batches expose the provider's metric diagnostics. Whole-KS
`estimate_resources`/resource-plan admission is rejected for DF until its
combined inventory is qualified; conventional inventories must not describe DF.

Large ordinary fitted CUDA force workloads may use the native active-AO bitmask
consumer under the unchanged stationary force budgets. It examines all requested
AO value/derivative jets at the existing `1e-16` force cutoff, including second
derivatives where needed; SCF masks are not reused for a different derivative
order. No grid points, weights or Becke response terms are pruned. Missing map
capabilities, insufficient optional storage or excessive AO occupancy retain
the dense bounded consumer. This admission does not include the separate DF
response owner's memory or establish a whole-force peak-memory bound. See
[stationary CUDA scheduling](../developer/stationary_cuda_scheduling.md).

For a CUDA restricted fitted hybrid with method-owned integer occupations,
automatic value storage keeps a fully resident dense owner when it fits. If
dense storage would stream, the same planner may instead retain one symmetric
packed fitted tensor within the resolved DF envelope. For live automatic
budgets only, the singleton restricted owner may rebalance the value/response
split to admit it without increasing the total cap or consuming device
headroom. Response retains at least 20% of that envelope and a conservative
bounded occupied-response workspace; if both owners cannot fit, the original
split and streamed fallback remain. Explicit positive budgets and failed
memory probes retain their original split. The same bounded admission may
retain the method-owned complete occupied projection for the future force
endpoint, rather than dropping it while unused response capacity remains.
The completed projection still requires a valid final-state lease. Optional complete
occupied projections remain separately charged and may be dropped. When the
packed owner cannot fit, the bounded dense/source fallback remains available.
Packed-single preparation batches metric transforms across lower AO-pair rows
within the existing charged scratch buffers; it does not allocate a retained
raw tensor or change the symmetric whitening convention.
Explicit `GENERATIVEQC_DF_VALUE_STORAGE` selections stay authoritative;
unrestricted and arbitrary-density prepared callers do not acquire this policy
from their dimensions alone. This changes source reuse, not the fitting metric,
SCF thresholds or numerical precision.

For a matched prepared-owner cold comparison, use
[`benchmarks/pbe0_df_cold.py`](../../benchmarks/pbe0_df_cold.py) through Slurm.
It measures preparation through the first synchronized public result with a
fresh process, owner and density, retaining persistent disk caches. Imports,
CUDA context initialization, native Calculator construction and post-result
owner/process teardown are outside that endpoint timer. Energy-only and
energy-plus-force runs are separate cold calculations.

Qualified force calculations use token-checked derivative snapshots and the
prepared DF response provider. The CPU diagnostic requires `execution="native"`
for a fitted state; the Direct-only reference derivative path is rejected rather
than differentiating a different Hamiltonian.

The CPU bridge contracts retained host H'/S' derivatives for the one-electron
and Pulay sources. CUDA fitted energy preparation defers those coordinate-major
matrices when retaining future force capability. CUDA first borrows the
token-checked final stationary D/W
already retained by the KS owner and runs the bounded paired one-electron
consumer without uploading those AO matrices again. If that optional device
consumer cannot be admitted under the caller's budget, the prepared owner
materializes H'/S' with the same CUDA exporter on demand, retains them for
replay, and uses the exact host contraction as its bounded fallback. Explicit
derivative Fock preparations still export their requested matrices eagerly.

For restricted CUDA DF response, the Coulomb J' component also borrows the exact
final resident density under the same live KS token. The detached host density
remains the finite/symmetric scientific witness, but the response bridge reads
the device matrix directly and therefore reports zero density H2D bytes for
that J-only call. Exchange K' deliberately keeps its existing density/projection
path in this change, and unrestricted/multi-term response retains the ordinary
upload path. This is therefore not a zero-upload resident whole-force path.

Full-rank J-only response contracts the resident whitened factor once with the
folded density, applies its symmetric metric root to that charge, and emits
bounded three-center and metric cotangents. It does not repeatedly refit AO
panels or construct exchange-style AO Gram matrices. Rank-deficient metrics,
mixed J/K terms and diagnostic algebra retain their general response routes.
`GENERATIVEQC_DF_COULOMB_RESPONSE=panels` selects the original bounded-panel
route for qualification; the default is `auto`. Both preserve the same metric
gauge, auxiliary-center response and derivative consumer.

The known native DF snapshot provider separately bounds its additional paired
one-electron/publication storage; DF response scratch stays in its independent
resource contract. Spare geometry budget admits point-parallel Becke phases.
Automatic large fitted grids prefer 256-point tiles to leave room for that
cache; explicit tiles, unknown providers and insufficient budgets retain their
bounded fallback. Reported one-electron device usage must fit the reserved
envelope, rather than relying on unaccounted memory.

Resource metadata distinguishes the resident one-electron path from its host
fallback; `density_fitted_response_resources_included=0` still explicitly
excludes unmeasured DF-provider scratch and transfers. These partial diagnostics
cannot establish a whole-force memory or transport bound. Full DF resource-plan
admission remains unqualified.

`tests/python/test_dft_df_public.py` compares independently converged PySCF
energies and analytic gradients with copied orbital/auxiliary primitives and
identical moving quadrature (absolute energy gate `1e-8 Eh`, force gate
`3e-7 Eh/bohr`, physical residual below `1e-9`). GPU acceptance
requires `GENERATIVEQC_DFT_CUDA_TEST=1` and a scheduler-allocated CUDA device.
