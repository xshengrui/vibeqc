# Native C++ SDK: explicit Kohn-Sham methods

The installed `libgenerativeqc` executes native DFT SCF without starting
Python. Python remains a build-time dependency for generated kernels, not a
requirement of the installed C/C++ runtime.

## Native manifest names

`generativeqc::resolve_method("pbe-rks")` and
`generativeqc::default_method_descriptor("pbe-rks")` use the
**generated native ABI registry**. Names such as `pbe0-rks`, `b3lyp-rks`
and `wb97m-v` are compiler-owned scientific compositions; they are not
native ABI IDs. Do not guess an ABI number for them.

  generativeqc::Context context(ctx_desc);

  generativeqc_system_descriptor sys_desc{
      sizeof(generativeqc_system_descriptor), GENERATIVEQC_ABI_VERSION,
      atoms.data(), static_cast<std::uint32_t>(atoms.size()),
      shells.data(), static_cast<std::uint32_t>(shells.size()),
      primitives.data(), static_cast<std::uint32_t>(primitives.size()),
      0, 1, GENERATIVEQC_BASIS_CARTESIAN};
  generativeqc::System system(context, sys_desc);

  // Explicit MethodIR-equivalent PBE0: 75% PBE exchange,
  // 100% PBE correlation, 25% full-range exact exchange.
  generativeqc::KsComposition pbe0(
      GENERATIVEQC_METHOD_PBE_RKS, "semilocal-scaled-v1/pbe-spin-c2-1e-18", 1);
  pbe0.set_grid({1, 64, 12, 24, 3, 1.0e-12, 256})
      .add_semilocal("GGA_C_PBE", 1.0)
      .add_semilocal("GGA_X_PBE", 0.75)
      .add_exact_exchange(GENERATIVEQC_KS_EXCHANGE_FULL_RANGE, 0.25);

  auto descriptor = generativeqc::default_method_descriptor("pbe-rks");
  descriptor.max_iterations = 200;
  descriptor.energy_tolerance = 1.0e-12;
  descriptor.density_tolerance = 1.0e-10;
  auto calculation = pbe0.prepare(context, system, descriptor);
  auto result = calculation.execute(GENERATIVEQC_PROPERTY_ENERGY);
  std::cout << result.energy << " Eh\n";
}
```

The C++ `KsComposition` owns its strings and exchange terms; its
`prepare()` call supplies an immutable snapshot to the native calculation.
Callers need not manage temporary C descriptor pointers. The example uses a
**small reference grid** for H₂, not a universal production quadrature.
Select and converge the grid for your real system.

A native client can also use the C ABI's
`generativeqc_method_from_name` / `generativeqc_method_get_name` to query
stable provider identities. Every native DFT request remains subject to
runtime validation of its physical composition, backend and basis.

## Density fitting and derivative boundary

For energy-only calculations, configure
`generativeqc_method_descriptor::density_fitting_mode` and optionally supply
`density_fitting_auxiliary_basis`, just as the native CLI does. CPU and CUDA
support depend on their qualified native provider and execution context.

**The public native `Calculation::execute()` currently advertises DFT energy
only.** Do not request forces, and do not interpret the presence of internal
native stationary derivative kernels as a usable C++ force endpoint.
The Python calculator has separately qualified DFT analytic-force paths that
still require a future, explicitly validated native public bridge. Requests
for unsupported properties fail rather than returning an incomplete gradient.
