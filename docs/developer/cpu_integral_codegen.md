# Generated CPU integral backend

The generated CPU integral path keeps the scientific Gaussian-integral
recurrence in the existing compiler DAG. CPU specialization begins only after
that DAG has been built.

## Dense HF preparation

Value-only full-range s/p/d ERI quartets share primitive geometry, Boys values
and Coulomb auxiliaries across their Cartesian components. Eligibility is
per quartet: adding an f/g shell does not disable this reuse for the remaining
s/p/d quartets. Value-only quartets containing f additionally reuse the retained
Hermite/Coulomb recurrence's preparation across all components of each primitive
quartet. This is a scheduling change, not a new recurrence: the scalar oracle
and shared consumer use the same Hermite and Coulomb recurrence functions. The
value-only consumer contracts their FP64 values without empty derivative Jets;
the scalar/derivative primitive retains its monolithic contraction. Its
invocation-local component buffer is bounded by one ffff quartet (10,000 values),
not molecule size. Quartets containing g+ and all nuclear derivatives retain
their scalar schedule. The value passes own disjoint eightfold orbits; neither
drops nor recomputes contributions. Generated s/p/d scratch remains one dddd
quartet, and higher-l scratch is released before spherical projection.

Integral producers project spherical tensors once per eightfold orbit, including
physical-atom nuclear derivatives and value-only range-separated ERIs. This
preserves the operator, normalization and reduction within each representative;
other orientations can differ in their last floating-point bits from separate
ordered reductions. `transform_integrals` does not assert this invariant and
continues to transform arbitrary caller-supplied tensors in their ordered domain.
The existing all-s/p/d value-only shell-local projection remains unchanged.

`benchmarks/cpu_hf_high_l.py` checks complete fresh-object CPU RHF calls at original
and changed geometries against independent PySCF energies and optional analytic
forces. Select baseline and candidate libraries in separate processes with
`GENERATIVEQC_LIBRARY`, keep thread settings identical, and compare iteration
counts as well as timing. Its work census is source-derived canonical
primitive-component and shared-geometry work, not measured hardware work. For
example:

```bash
OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 PYTHONPATH=python \
  GENERATIVEQC_LIBRARY="$PWD/build/cpu/libgenerativeqc.so" \
  python benchmarks/cpu_hf_high_l.py --case water-tzvp \
  --representation spherical --repeats 3 --output .artifacts/cpu-hf-tzvp.json
```

Use `--forces` for the complete energy-plus-force endpoint; energy-only samples
must not be reported as force timings. These changes do not alter CUDA dispatch.

## Lane mapping

The first SIMD schedule packs independent primitive records into lanes. Runtime
input records remain the established AoS ABI. A bounded execution tile
transposes the active records to an internal SoA layout so each exponent or
Cartesian coordinate is loaded contiguously by the generated vector kernel.

Incomplete final tiles are not read past the caller's input. Inactive lanes are
filled with finite coordinates, positive unit exponents, and zero contraction
weight. They therefore exercise an ordinary well-defined recurrence without
contributing to the result.

## Numerical policy

The scalar, AVX2, and AVX-512 candidates are lowered from the same
`ShellClassComponentKernel`; there is no shell-name-specific AVX recurrence.
Ordinary recurrence arithmetic uses backend vector values. Numerically
sensitive Boys construction and general transcendental operations are evaluated
with the strict scalar C++ library function independently in each active SIMD
lane, then loaded back into vector values.

Compilation uses explicit target flags such as `-mavx2 -mfma` or
`-mavx512f -mfma`, never `-march=native`. The baseline has no SIMD ISA
requirement. `-ffp-contract=off` remains explicit, and no fast-math mode is
enabled. FMA is a schedule decision rather than a global numerical-policy
change. The initial target record accepts only its exact declared ISA flags;
arbitrary extra compiler options and non-integer lane widths are rejected.
See the [arithmetic admission decision](../../.agents/notes/implemented/numerics/2026-09-19-cpu-target-arithmetic-admission.md).

## Validation and benchmark

`tests/python/test_cpu_lane.py` compiles generic, AVX2, and AVX-512 source
from one ERI DAG. On supporting hosts it executes the ISA-specific candidates,
including a partial SIMD tail, and compares raw values plus all twelve
four-center nuclear derivatives with the independent native integral oracle.

The retained node3 benchmark is
`benchmarks/results/issue469-cpu-simd.json`. Reproduce it with:

```bash
OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 PYTHONPATH=python \
  python benchmarks/issue469_cpu_simd.py \
  --shell fdps --records 2048 --samples 80
```

For the measured FDPS component, the generic generated candidate took
2.464011 ms median and AVX2 took 1.2937415 ms, a 1.9046x speedup. Their final
outputs had zero observed absolute difference. The same host compiled the
AVX-512 candidate but did not advertise AVX-512F, so that binary was not
executed.

This qualification is a generated-kernel result, not a claim that the current
SCF CPU default has been replaced. Portable runtime ISA selection and
multi-variant dispatch are tracked separately by #470; CPU cost-model and
schedule autotuning are tracked by #471. The independent native oracle remains
outside this generated production-candidate path.

## Portable multi-ISA bundles and runtime dispatch

A generated CPU artifact can be materialized as one relocatable directory with
`compile_first_derivative_cpu_bundle`. On x86-64 the default bundle contains
three independently compiled candidates:

- `generic`: scalar baseline with no AVX requirement;
- `x86_64-avx2-fma`: four FP64 lanes;
- `x86_64-avx512f-fma`: eight FP64 lanes.

The bundle manifest records the IntegralIR payload, component selection, target
and schedule payloads, compiler/runtime artifact key, binary SHA-256, and
relative library path for every candidate. Its bundle identity therefore
changes if scientific source, target features, compiler identity, relevant
flags, schedule, or binary content changes. The libraries live below the
manifest with relative paths, so the complete directory can be relocated as
package data without retaining the build cache.

`load_first_derivative_cpu_bundle` parses and verifies this manifest without
calling `ctypes.CDLL` on any candidate. Runtime dispatch proceeds in this
order:

1. detect the current architecture and only the ISA facts required by the
   candidates;
2. select the widest compatible target;
3. reject an explicitly forced but unsupported target;
4. only then load the selected shared library.

Linux x86-64 feature detection uses kernel-advertised flags from
`/proc/cpuinfo`; macOS x86-64 uses `sysctl`. Unknown operating systems and
non-x86 architectures conservatively select a generic candidate when present.
CPU brand/model strings never participate in scientific or cache identity.

Set `GENERATIVEQC_CPU_TARGET=generic` to force the portable fallback for validation
or debugging. Forcing AVX2/AVX-512 on a runtime that does not advertise the
required features fails before the candidate binary is loaded.

`FirstDerivativeCpuDispatchEvaluator.diagnostics()` records the selected
target, runtime feature source, available bundle targets, forced-target policy,
bundle identity, and candidate artifact keys. The dispatch decision is
therefore visible in result provenance rather than being an implicit
`-march=native` side effect.

The runtime-dispatch tests emulate no-SIMD, AVX2, AVX-512, ARM/non-x86, forced
generic, and forced-unsupported cases. They also relocate a compiled bundle to
a new package-data directory and load it there before executing the
runtime-selected candidate. On node3, runtime detection reports x86-64 with
AVX2+FMA and selects the AVX2 candidate; a feature-empty x86-64 runtime selects
the generic candidate.
