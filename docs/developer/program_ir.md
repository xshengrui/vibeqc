# Serial ProgramIR and fixed-density XC tile lifetimes

`generativeqc_compiler.common.program` describes a **finite, synchronous sequence of
opaque provider calls**. It derives dependency and last-use information without
replacing IntegralIR, TensorIR, MethodIR, XC mathematics or native runtime owners.
This is a deliberately narrow compiler prototype, not a whole-program optimizer.

## Contracts

`ProgramBuffer` describes a disjoint ownership group and its numeric capacity.
It may also bind the shared `DenseLayout` plus item size when a producer/consumer
boundary has a qualified physical layout; the byte capacity must match exactly.
`PlanCall` binds a named provider identity to explicit read/write buffers.
`ProgramIR` validates the selected order and derives inclusive resource intervals.
A value must be an input or have exactly one earlier producer. Duplicate owners,
missing/forward/cyclic dependencies and in-place writes fail before analysis.
The chosen call order is part of the identity; no opaque call is deleted or moved.

Inputs are borrowed and retained for the complete region. Outputs survive through
publication. Other values become releasable **after** their last consuming call
finishes. Read and newly written buffers overlap during a call. There is no
input donation, alias analysis, view ownership inference or asynchronous release.
Providers must not retain undeclared aliases or launch unfinished work. An async
or aliasing provider needs a different explicit contract, not this serial model.

Serialization contains data only. `ProgramIR.from_payload()` rejects unknown or
missing fields and reconstructs validation rather than trusting serialized
lifetime claims. Identity includes provider bindings, buffer capacities/spaces,
qualified dense layouts/item sizes, requested outputs and selected order. It is
not an executable cache key or a
certificate that a native library or numerical state is current.

`resource_request()` feeds the existing `common.resources` planner. Its accounting
is **boundary-only**: opaque-provider scratch/copies, library workspaces, Python
objects, allocator overhead and caller-retained result history are excluded.
The diagnostic `retain_temporaries=True` alternative is a retain-all model, not a
measurement of an existing runtime or an end-to-end performance baseline.

## First native consumer

For dense synchronous CPU potential requests, `PreparedXCContractions.tile_program`
is an immutable description of the existing path:

```text
borrowed basis + complete quadrature owner
                  |
                  v
          NativeAO.evaluate
                  | jets
                  v
    NativeContractionProgram.evaluate  <-- spin density + quadrature
                  |
                  v
       E_xc / V_xc / electron contribution
```

The XC provider already owns density features, scalar XC and potential assembly.
The graph deliberately does not invent separate native kernels for those stages.
The complete quadrature owner is charged once: point/weight tile views are not
misrepresented as independent allocations. Final partial tiles use the same
maximum capacity contract.

For this graph, `release_after("collocation")` is empty: Vxc still needs the AO
jets. `release_after("xc")` contains `jets`. The existing CPU execution template
recognizes that release contract and removes the consumer reference after use.
The suspended collocation generator drops its reference before allocating the
next tile. The caller also releases the consumed contribution after accumulation.
No second allocator, generic interpreter or new scientific arithmetic is added.

`tile_program` is `None` for spatial/CUDA and non-potential consumers. Those routes
retain their existing independent qualification boundaries. The complete native
resource budget remains unchanged and conservative. **Do not add the boundary
request to `prepared.resource_plan`: it would double-count existing buffers.**

Execution statistics expose `tile_program_identity` and `tile_boundary_releases`
only for the qualified dense CPU potential template. Graph construction and release
analysis happen during preparation, not per tile. Native state/provider checks,
numerical domains, quadrature, precision, reduction order and failure propagation
remain with the established owners.

## Second consumer: DFT feature layout into native XC

The initial lifetime slice kept the complete XC contraction opaque. The second
qualified slice is narrower scientifically but more explicit operationally: for
dense synchronous **polarized** CPU LDA/PBE potential tiles, ProgramIR records

```text
NativeAO.evaluate
      | [jet, point, AO]
      v
dft.density_feature_block
      | [feature, point] + optional [spin, point, xyz]
      v
xc.NativeContractionProgram.scalar_values_packed
      | generated scalar rows
      v
xc.NativeContractionProgram.potential_from_rows
```

The DFT feature producer owns one C-contiguous FP64 feature-major buffer. The
generated XC scalar consumer validates that exact owner without making the former
validation copy, active-point gather, variable `np.stack`, or output scatter.
Potential assembly still uses the existing coefficient and AO contraction code;
no XC formula, quadrature, spin convention or reduction order is duplicated.

The shared `DenseLayout` is the same physical-layout descriptor used by TensorIR,
but ProgramIR imports only the backend-neutral contract. It does not import the
TensorIR planner, choose arbitrary affine layouts, alias buffers, donate inputs,
or infer asynchronous lifetimes. Unpolarized, spatial, CUDA, response and geometry
routes retain their previous paths until independently qualified.

Execution statistics additionally expose `tile_layouts` for these real boundary
owners. Tests require the complete prepared endpoint to run with the legacy
`scalar_values` repacking entry point disabled and verify that the native scalar
input shares storage with the DFT-owned feature buffer.

## Logical SPMD lowering contract

`generativeqc_compiler.common.spmd` adds a backend-neutral lowering plan around the
immutable ProgramIR. The scientific ProgramIR remains schema v2 and does not
contain physical GPU ordinals, product names, links or topology assumptions.
A `DeviceMesh` names only logical axes. `BufferPlacement` describes whether a
boundary buffer is replicated or deterministically sharded along one dense tensor
axis, and `CollectiveSpec` makes all-reduce, reduce-scatter and all-gather
synchronization explicit. Scatter/gather tensor axes are explicit, and their
result placement is validated against the buffer contract. All-to-all is
intentionally absent until a real consumer requires it.

The same ProgramIR identity can therefore be lowered to a one-device mesh or a
larger mesh. Size-one collectives canonicalize away, so the one-device lowering is
the fallback rather than a separate scientific equation. Mesh shape, placement,
collective order and logical shard coordinates participate in the SPMD plan and
provenance identities. Replaying serialized SPMD metadata revalidates the bound
ProgramIR identity and all placement/collective invariants.

The v1 accounting contract charges one communication scratch allocation per
logical rank and records collective source-plus-result traffic as the resource
candidate's relative-cost work count. This is deliberately not a hardware
latency/bandwidth prediction:
collective-library internals and physical interconnect properties remain explicit
scope exclusions until a target/backend supplies measured profitability evidence.
Backends must declare support for every required collective before execution.

A result publication boundary must call `require_complete_shards()`; missing,
duplicate or unexpected logical ranks fail instead of publishing a partial
scientific result. `reference_collective()` supplies pure CPU semantics for the
three v1 collectives so backend implementations can be qualified independently.

This contract does **not** yet make any existing XC/SCF path multi-GPU. The first
real bounded consumer, runtime collective binding and measured 1/2/4+ GPU endpoint
scaling remain follow-up work under #834. That qualification must reuse this
logical contract rather than adding method- or GPU-name-specific scientific IR.

Rationale:
[ProgramIR SPMD contract decision](../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-09-21-programir-spmd-contract.md).

## Structured bounded solver regions

`generativeqc_compiler.common.solver_region.SolverRegion` adds a structured loop
contract **above** serial ProgramIR without changing ProgramIR schema v2. The
body remains ordinary SSA: immutable inputs are declared as invariants and every
loop-carried value is an explicit `current -> next` pair. `max_steps` is a
strict finite bound; the compiler does not invent an unbounded while loop.

Convergence and failure predicates carry stable provider-owned identities rather
than embedding SCF/CC policy in generic compiler code. Checkpoints state exactly
which buffers may be observed at entry, per-iteration, success, failure or exit,
and `host_visible` is explicit. Generic completion supports only `scalar`.
`RegionCompletion.active_mask` remains a reserved null field so existing scalar
schema-v1 payloads and region identities are unchanged. Construction and replay
reject `per_item_mask`, unknown modes, and non-null masks rather than silently
reinterpreting them. Ragged batch completion, per-item failure isolation and
warm-state publication remain with the existing method-owned controllers.

Derivative behavior is also explicit. `derivative_policy` is either
`unsupported` or `custom`; a custom region must register identified first-order
implicit/stationary JVP/VJP rules. An unregistered derivative request raises
instead of tracing or retaining iteration history. Registering first order does
not imply higher-order support.

The region resource request reuses the body's boundary allocation once across
all bounded steps; `max_steps` does not multiply reusable capacities. As with
ProgramIR, provider-internal solver history, library scratch and caller-retained
checkpoint payloads remain outside that boundary unless a future consumer exposes
them as named owners.

The first existing endpoint represented by this contract is conventional RCCSD
in `tools.generativeqc_cc.solver.PreparedCCSD.solver_region`. Its numerical loop is
unchanged: the region records the existing optimized TensorIR equation identity,
DIIS/control state as explicit carried dependencies, the exact
`max_iterations + 1` evaluation bound, the existing energy/residual plus fresh
expanded-equation acceptance rule, nonfinite failure semantics and host-visible
publication points. User-supplied initial amplitudes remain the ordinary solver
initial state. The solver result records the region identity and bound.

The RCCSD consumer remains descriptive: execution still uses the established
Python loop, so it makes **no host-overhead or speedup claim**. Its CPU result
also retains the exact serialized region. The Lambda boundary reconstructs and
checks that region against the executed identity/bound before response work.
Only after the existing checked transpose solve and independent stationarity
gate succeed does the response bind an identified `implicit_vjp` rule to a
derived `custom` region. Parameter-weight requests consult that registered rule
and fail closed on a missing or stale identity; no CC iteration tape is retained.
The specialized CC rule keeps the existing independently weighted T2 coordinate
contract rather than pretending the redundant dense T2 representation is the
generic `ImplicitSolveSpec` coordinate model.

CUDA now also has
a method-neutral `runtime::SolverRegionCudaExecutor` that bounds native body
submission and delegates optional capture/replay to the existing shared
`CudaGraphRegion` lifecycle. The opt-in direct-RKS two-iteration path from #370
is its first execution consumer; KS still owns convergence, DIIS, occupations,
failure handling, and publication.

The native binding also supports only scalar completion and rejects unsupported
numeric mode values before submitting work or changing replay state. It preserves
the scalar replay key, bounds each submission by requested steps, remaining
steps and checkpoint capacity, and leaves convergence/failure/publication policy
with KS. Qualified semilocal KS replay remains opt-in with its existing ordinary
stream fallback; retiring generic mask admission does not change those gates.

See [the structured-region architecture note](../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-09-21-structured-solver-regions.md),
[the CUDA execution follow-up](../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-09-21-cuda-solver-region-executor.md),
and [the scalar-only completion decision](../../.agents/notes/implemented/compatibility/2026-10-08-retire-unused-solver-region-mask.md).

## Shared storage analysis

The first #831 compiler slice adds `ProgramIR.storage_analysis()` on top of the
backend-neutral `common.storage` contract. The same analysis is also adapted by
TensorIR CUDA plans, so ownership groups, aliases, live ranges, interference,
reusable slots and simultaneous-live bytes have one fail-closed representation.
ProgramIR last-use resource intervals now consume these shared ranges.

This remains analysis, not a second allocator. Unknown alias metadata blocks
reuse for its memory space and opaque effects retain touched owners through the
region boundary. TensorIR keeps its qualified arena offsets as the execution plan
of record until a later #831 slice independently validates allocator migration.

ProgramStoragePlan schema v2 also admits explicit same-call ownership transfer
through `CallDonationBinding`. A donation maps one call read to one call write
and is forwarded to the same backend-neutral storage analyzer used by TensorIR.
The donor and recipient must resolve to compiler-owned physical owners with equal
capacity in one memory space, the donor must die at that call, and an opaque call
is rejected. Donation therefore removes only one proven interference edge; it is
never inferred from liveness alone, does not donate borrowed inputs, and does not
turn ProgramIR providers into implicit in-place operations. Schema-v1 replay
remains supported for plans without donation metadata.

The first production layout-propagation slice now goes one step beyond the #460
feature-input prototype on polarized native CPU fixed-density potentials. Scalar
XC writes a consumer-ready physical owner whose first row is energy and whose
remaining rows are the complete feature gradient; inactive derivative rows are
exact zero. The generated Vxc coefficient function borrows those rows and the
DFT-owned density-gradient block directly, avoiding the previous gradient rebuild,
immutable input copies, variable stack, and stack copy. The generic ABI remains
the fallback for routes outside this qualification. `xc_rows` `DenseLayout` and
the generated packed root-row metadata are both hashed, so a physical execution
layout change invalidates the ProgramIR/native artifact identity deliberately.

Rationale and measured endpoint evidence:
[XC row-layout propagation](../../.agents/notes/implemented/performance/2026-09-21-programir-xc-row-layout-propagation.md).

## Validation and reproduction

```bash
PYTHONPATH=python:. python -m pytest -q \
  tests/python/test_program_ir.py tests/python/test_program_spmd.py \
  tests/python/test_solver_region.py tests/python/test_cc_solver.py \
  tests/python/test_program_ir_xc.py \
  tests/python/test_xc_contractions_native.py
PYTHONPATH=python:. python tools/check_compiler_structure.py
```

Native tests require an available CPU library and C++ compiler. They use independent
LDA/PBE energy/potential fixtures, repeated and changed densities, partial tiles,
and weak references checked at the **next actual native AO allocation**.

The benchmark below separates instrumentation from ordinary complete fixed-density
E/V timings. Use the same explicit native library and thread settings for two
checkouts, pointing `PYTHONPATH` at the checkout being tested and running the same
benchmark script. Source/library identities and raw timing samples are reported.

```bash
export GENERATIVEQC_LIBRARY=/path/to/qualified/cpu/libgenerativeqc.so
OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 PYTHONPATH=python:. \
  python benchmarks/programir_xc_lifetimes.py --case f_spherical --repeats 11
```

The reported live boundary payload is **not** a process RSS or device peak.
Freeing a boundary earlier does not prove a smaller complete-endpoint peak, since
provider-internal scratch may dominate. Fixed-density XC is not a full SCF,
force, geometry optimization or GPU benchmark. Extend the prototype only when a
separate consumer and measured benefit justify more machinery.
