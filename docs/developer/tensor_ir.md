# TensorIR: typed equations and a CPU reference interpreter

`python/generativeqc_compiler/tensor/` implements the CG08 foundation in issue #145. It describes
real tensor equations, validates them before execution, and replays them with
NumPy on CPU. It includes independent loop references for a matrix product, a
spin-orbital MP2-like energy fragment, one virtual Fock contribution to a CC-like
residual, and a restricted spatial pair-symmetrized update. These fragments do
not implement a complete MP2 or CCSD method.

`IntegralIR` owns integral operators, shell/center identities, nuclear
derivatives, and bounded integral providers. `TensorIR` owns tensor index
populations and algebra over supplied arrays. Neither inherits from the other;
TensorIR does not import `ShellClassSpec` or require CUDA. Physical strides,
device placement and contraction planning live in the separate
[prepared FP64 CUDA executor](tensor_cuda.md) (#146). #151 now adds primitive
JVP/VJP rules and demand-driven derivative programs; the generated programs
reuse that executor. The table below describes the original CG08 boundary;
the CUDA document records the subsequent execution capabilities.

| Stage | CG08 capability |
| --- | --- |
| Mathematical representation and legality | Implemented for the primitives below |
| CPU interpretation and debug intermediates | Implemented and checked against explicit loops |
| JSON replay and logical equation hashing | Implemented, versioned, fail closed |
| Generated source | Stable node-name/type/primitive contract only; no source emitter |
| CUDA compilation and GPU numerical validation | Not implemented by this issue |
| Complete molecular method/endpoint/production selection | Not implemented by these fragments |

## Types and index conventions

`IndexSpace(name, kind, size, spin=None)` names an explicitly sized population.
Kinds are `occupied`, `virtual`, `orbital`, `ao`, `auxiliary`, `batch`, and `spin`;
`orbital` denotes a complete MO population and remains distinct from AO and
occupied/virtual populations even when dimensions coincide;
optional spin labels are `alpha` and `beta`. Distinct populations remain distinct
even when their extents match. Space names must have one definition throughout
a program. Nuclear centers and atom identities remain on the integral side.

`Index(name, space, start=0, stop=None, selection=None)` selects a half-open
range. Slice coordinates are local to that range. A gather retains its ordered
global coordinates, including repeats. Equating differently ordered gathers or
different blocks merely because their shapes agree is illegal. Einstein labels
are local to each contraction; reusing one label for different populations,
spins, or selected ranges is an error. Tensor axis names are notation and do
not alter a logical hash.

`TensorSpec` records ordered indices, dtype, declared symmetries, orbital
representation, parameter role, and differentiability. Real scientific values
use `float64` or `float32`. Boolean data uses one-byte `bool` storage and may be
an input, constant, or intermediate; it is always general, symmetry-free, and
non-differentiable. Immutable runtime index controls use `int64` input/parameter
specs and are likewise general, symmetry-free, and non-differentiable. Roles are
`input`, `parameter`, `constant`, and `intermediate`. Constants cannot be
differentiable. Result differentiability propagates only through admitted real
operations; this marks future AD inputs without claiming implemented derivatives.

Representations are `general`, `restricted_spatial`, and `spin_orbital`.
Operands of an arithmetic operation must agree on representation and dtype.
Cross-dtype boundaries are represented only by the explicit `cast` primitive;
there is no implicit promotion. The six comparisons require same-domain,
same-representation real operands and produce Boolean intermediates. Boolean
transpose, reshape, slice, gather, and broadcast preserve dtype, but Boolean
arithmetic, reductions, einsum, casts, and AD reject explicitly. In particular,
restricted spatial amplitudes obey the simultaneous exchange

```text
t[i,j,a,b] = t[j,i,b,a]             Symmetry((1,0,3,2), +1)
```

This does not assert separate occupied or virtual antisymmetry. Spin-orbital
antisymmetries require explicit declarations:

```text
t[i,j,a,b] = -t[j,i,a,b]           Symmetry((1,0,2,3), -1)
t[i,j,a,b] = -t[i,j,b,a]           Symmetry((0,1,3,2), -1)
```

The interpreter checks declared input symmetries. Transpose transports them;
addition retains declarations shared by all operands. Other operations drop
unproved declarations. Equal shapes cannot justify extra symmetry.

## Construct and replay an equation

Run this from the repository root:

```python
import numpy as np
from generativeqc_compiler.tensor import (
    Index,
    IndexSpace,
    Program,
    TensorSpec,
    einsum,
    execute,
    input_tensor,
)

ao = IndexSpace("ao", "ao", 2)
aux = IndexSpace("aux", "auxiliary", 3)
a = input_tensor("a", TensorSpec((Index("p", ao), Index("P", aux)), role="input"))
b = input_tensor(
    "b",
    TensorSpec(
        (Index("P", aux), Index("q", ao)), role="parameter", differentiable=True
    ),
)
program = Program({"c": einsum("pP,Pq->pq", a, b)}, provenance={"equation_version": 1})
replayed = Program.loads(program.dumps())
result = execute(replayed, {"a": np.ones((2, 3)), "b": np.ones((3, 2))}, debug=True)
assert np.array_equal(result.outputs["c"], np.full((2, 2), 3.0))
assert replayed.logical_hash == program.logical_hash
```

`Execution.intermediates` maps stable, source-safe `Program.debug_names` to
snapshots of every executed node. `Program.nodes` retains explicit definitions;
`live_nodes` contains output-reachable definitions. Definitions may be retained
for inspecting the original mathematical DAG even after producing an optimized
program.

All values follow immutable SSA semantics. There are no in-place destinations,
so a transpose/slice/broadcast view cannot be overwritten by another node.
Inputs may be noncontiguous, negative-stride, read-only, or share memory with
other inputs. Each returned output/debug array is detached from all inputs and
other returned arrays. Extra unused feeds are allowed when comparing original
and optimized programs. Missing feeds, wrong dtypes/shapes, nonfinite values,
division by zero, and arithmetic overflow fail explicitly.

## Primitive contracts

| Factory | Semantics and constraints |
| --- | --- |
| `constant(values, spec=None)` | Exact rational real or literal Boolean scalar/flattened C-order values; default is an FP64 scalar |
| `cast(value, dtype)` | Explicit real FP32/FP64 storage/compute boundary; logical axes, representation, symmetry and differentiability are preserved |
| `compare(op, left, right)` | `equal`, `not_equal`, `greater`, `greater_equal`, `less`, or `less_equal` on identical real domains/dtypes; produces non-differentiable Boolean data |
| `add(*values, coefficients=...)` | Ordered rational-scaled sum; equal domains, no implicit broadcast or dtype promotion |
| `multiply(a,b)`, `divide(a,b)` | Elementwise operations on equal domains |
| `einsum("...->...", *values, coefficient=...)` | Explicit-output alphabetic labels; traces/repeated input labels and scalar terms supported; literal ellipses unsupported |
| `transpose(value, axes)` | Full permutation of logical axes; preserves real or Boolean dtype |
| `reshape(value, indices)` | Explicit C-order logical reshape with equal element count; preserves real or Boolean dtype, may require a physical copy, and does not transform an orbital basis |
| `slice_tensor(value, ranges)` | One nonnegative unit-step half-open local range per axis; preserves real or Boolean dtype |
| `gather(value, axis, positions)` | Static validated positions, including repeated and reordered positions; preserves real or Boolean dtype |
| `reduce_sum(value, axes)` | Sum specified axes; full reduction yields a rank-zero scalar |
| `broadcast(value, indices, axes)` | Insert new axes using an explicit input-to-output map; existing axis domains and real/Boolean dtype remain unchanged |

An existing singleton cannot silently become a different population. Reduce
away that axis before explicitly broadcasting it. Empty tensors and zero-length
contractions are valid; empty sums are zero. Dimension/byte products use a
checked signed-64-bit contract before allocation. `execute(max_bytes=...)`
defaults to 256 MiB and bounds logical retained arrays plus returned snapshots.
It does not claim a bound on NumPy internal scratch, Python objects, or process
RSS. CUDA allocation planning has its own explicit [budget scope](tensor_cuda.md).

### Precision scheduling

Issue #528 adds `PrecisionDirective(storage_dtype, compute_dtype,
accumulation_dtype)` and `lower_precision`. The directive is a scheduling
request, while the lowered program remains an ordinary typed TensorIR DAG whose
precision changes are visible as `cast` nodes. `describe_precision` produces a
stable `PrecisionSchedule` identity containing every live floating value's
resolved dtype, sensitivity class, cast traffic, strict-audit dtype and
arithmetic mode. Boolean data and `int64` controls are outside floating precision
schedules, and directives targeting either fail closed. If real arithmetic that
feeds a comparison is precision-rewritten, the comparison boundary restores each
operand's declared dtype before rebuilding the Boolean value.

The default schedule remains strict FP64. `conservative_precision_variants`
only creates an opt-in FP32 candidate for ordinary elementwise/view subgraphs;
reductions/contractions and numerically sensitive operations stay FP64 unless a
caller supplies explicit qualification. Qualified `reduce` and `einsum` values can use FP32
storage/compute with an FP64 serial accumulator; all other distinct
compute/accumulation combinations fail closed. Mixed-accumulation einsums use
the generated reduction kernel rather than pretending SGEMM provides wider
accumulation. Generated JVP/VJP programs preserve explicit cast boundaries and
the parent precision identity, but primal qualification never grants derivative
qualification automatically.

Compile-time coefficients accept integers, `Fraction`, or exact rational
strings such as `"1/4"`. Float coefficients are rejected. Serialization stores
reduced numerator/positive-denominator pairs; conversion happens in the chosen
real dtype during interpretation. No complex values, conjugation, arbitrary
expression evaluation, SCF/CC loops, or mutable scatter operations are supported.

`PRIMITIVES` declares differentiable-operand and accumulation contracts for real
operations and marks comparisons explicitly non-differentiable. `autodiff.py`
implements JVP/VJP rules for every differentiable primitive; Boolean-capable
views participate in AD only for real-valued paths. Repeated gathers use
scatter-add in a VJP, and repeated einsum labels use exact identity projections
in generated reverse programs. Shapes live in each typed node.

## Independent/packed amplitudes

`PackedLayout.from_spec(spec, max_elements=...)` enumerates signed orbits of the
declared symmetry generators. The bounded CPU reference defaults to one million
dense elements. `pack` checks symmetry rather than projecting an arbitrary
tensor; `unpack` expands independent coordinates. Antisymmetric fixed points
are structural zeros. Singleton orbits, empty tensors, and all-zero orbits are
supported.

`dense_to_packed`, `signs`, and `representatives` specify the mapping.
`weights` holds orbit multiplicities:

```text
sum_dense unpack(x) * unpack(y) = sum_packed weights * x * y
```

`inner_product(x,y)` implements this metric. For two occupied and three virtual
orbitals, the spatial pair layout has 21 independent coordinates with weights
1 or 2, while separate spin-orbital antisymmetries have 3 coordinates with weight
4. `unpack_transpose` and `pack_transpose` implement the exact adjoints under
this metric; the reverse of `unpack` is not ordinary `pack`. Generated reverse
programs apply the weighted transpose when a packed parameter is requested with
`packed=...`. `to_payload`/`from_payload` preserve and verify the complete map
and metric.

## Derivative programs (#151)

`python/generativeqc_compiler/tensor/autodiff.py` provides a CPU reference for
JVP (`jvp`) and matrix-free VJP (`vjp`) with an adjoint dot test (`dot_test`). It
covers every differentiable primitive, preserves exact rational coefficients,
accumulates multiple consumers, and rejects a runtime AD request when its live
program contains Boolean data. The interpreter deliberately treats
packed/symmetric parameters as dense general tensors only through an explicit
packing boundary; callers must not replace the weighted adjoint with an
unweighted Euclidean one.

Distinct input nodes with the same public name read one feed: VJPs sum all
their contributions, including before common-subexpression elimination. The
generated reverse graph starts from every occurrence of each requested input
and builds only active operand adjoints, so an unrequested diagonal projection
cannot consume the generation element budget. Repeated einsum labels that
survive in the output retain their cotangent axis in the diagonal embedding.

`python/generativeqc_compiler/tensor/ad_program.py` turns the same rules into demand-driven,
backend-independent TensorIR `Program` DAGs:

- `linearize(program, tangent_inputs, outputs=..., packed=...)` generates
  forward programs whose inputs are the original parameters plus `d_<name>`
  tangents and whose outputs are `d_<output>` tangents.
- `transpose_program(program, cotangent_outputs, inputs=..., packed=...)`
  generates reverse programs whose inputs are the original parameters plus
  `bar_<output>` cotangents and whose outputs are `bar_<input>` cotangents.
- Only requested paths produce nodes; an inactive requested output becomes an
  explicit zero-like node. Generated programs are replayable with
  `Program.dumps()` and can be passed directly to `plan_cuda`.
- Unrelated Boolean diagnostic outputs are pruned from a requested real path.
  Selecting a Boolean output or a real output whose ancestors contain Boolean
  data rejects as non-differentiable; selected-branch `where` AD is not part of
  this contract.
- Reverse slice/gather use exact incidence matrices. Repeated einsum labels
  use exact identity projections. A packed parameter is expanded through an
  explicit unpack DAG, and its reverse output applies `unpack_transpose`
  (including orbit weights).

The generated reverse programs are matrix-free: their node count follows the
primal DAG and never materializes a dense Jacobian or a tape growing with
solver iterations. `tools/tensor_ad_examples.py` compiles and executes a
fixed, unconverged CC-like scalar-energy fragment on CUDA and compares JVP/VJP
against the CPU interpreter and directional finite differences. The recorded
RTX 5090 evidence in
[`benchmarks/results/tensor-ad-151`](../../benchmarks/results/tensor-ad-151/README.md)
passes both directions with a dot relative error of `3.97e-16`; it is not a
complete CCSD/MP2 method and makes no production-promotion claim.

## Method-level matrix-function custom rule

The [symmetric matrix-function rule](matrix_function.md) owns the first-order
inverse-square-root spectral semantics above TensorIR. It emits the projection,
divided-difference weighting and back-projection as an ordinary response
`Program`, and can consume a cotangent generated by `transpose_program`.
Its spectral coefficients are fixed at one checked CPU primal state. This does
not register a new TensorIR opcode, grant second matrix-function derivatives,
or imply native/GPU factorization or a complete molecular force capability.

## Rewrites and serialization

`rewrite(program, pass_name)` exposes `dead_nodes`, `identity_transposes`,
`exact_cse`, and `scalar_constants` separately. `optimize` applies those passes
and a final duplicate/dead cleanup, returning a new program with source-hash
provenance. It never overwrites the original DAG. CSE includes spaces, ranges,
spins, dtype, symmetry, representation, input identity/role, and differentiability.
Default optimization still performs no floating-point reassociation or implied
symmetry rewrite.  Symbolic complexity analysis is available through
`analyze_complexity(program)`, which reports shape-derived storage/work orders
such as `O(N^4)` without assuming sparsity, density fitting, or low rank.
`reassociate_einsums(program)` and
`optimize(..., reassociate_contractions=True)` are explicit opt-ins: bounded
n-ary einsums are searched for a binary tree with a strictly lower symbolic
degree, then existing GEMM recognition can lower eligible binary contractions.
The opt-in is required because an equivalent contraction tree changes
floating-point reduction order. Programs carrying an explicit
`precision_execution` contract currently fail closed under reassociation until
intermediate-node precision propagation is defined.

Constant folding is deliberately limited to scalar rational add/multiply/divide
subgraphs. The replacement must reproduce the original dtype result bit for
bit; cancellation, overflow, signed-zero changes, or invalid division cannot
be hidden by rational simplification. Array constant folding is deferred.

The `generativeqc.tensor` schema and primitive definitions are versioned independently.
Replay validates every node, shape, attribute, dependency, convention, logical
hash, and stable debug name. It rejects unknown versions/primitives, forward
references, duplicate JSON keys, and incompatible declarations. Serialization
contains data only and never uses `eval` or pickle.

Logical identity includes exact factors, conventions, versions, ordered
operations, and output names. Dummy Einstein labels are normalized by first
occurrence; tensor axis spelling, dictionary insertion order, construction
order of independent nodes, dead definitions, and provenance do not alter that
identity. This is structural equation identity, not a proof that differently
associated algebra has the same floating-point value.

## Integral block and external-weight exchange

The adapter consumes `BlockResponse.layout` element strides and logical offsets
to form an array with a `TensorSpec`. Each tensor index names the appropriate AO
or auxiliary population and explicitly selects the block's range. It must also
honor the response status, AO order/normalization, tile identity, and center maps.
The test `test_integral_raw_tile_to_tensor_weights_and_back_has_explicit_order_and_sign`
shows a complete bounded exchange, including padded integral storage:

1. Assemble an overlap raw block for a partial AO tile.
2. Gather its logical elements from the declared physical layout.
3. Compute external weights as a TensorIR equation.
4. Pack the result into a `WeightTile` matching the integral `WeightDescriptor`.
5. Contract first derivatives with `WeightedDerivative`, applying its explicit
   force sign and translation/atom mappings on the integral side.

For example, after validating the descriptor and response, the array boundary is:

```python
raw = np.array([response.values[k] for k in layout.offsets()]).reshape(spec.shape)
weights = execute(weight_program, {"raw": raw}).outputs["weights"]
buffer = np.zeros(layout.storage_elements)
buffer[list(layout.offsets())] = weights.ravel()
tile = WeightTile(layout, buffer)
```

A scalar prefactor already included in TensorIR must not be applied twice in
the weight descriptor. Arbitrary weights need not factor into HF density
products. This boundary allocates only requested tiles and does not construct
a molecular N⁴ integral or derivative tensor.

The runner uses the existing `generativeqc.validation` schema and controlled FP64
`atol=1e-11, rtol=1e-10` gates from #138. It checks original execution, JSON
replay, each rewrite, and optimized replay against independent loops. Exported
examples include actual inputs, reference values, the program, packing map,
versions, and seed. Evidence records include equation/IR/source hashes,
revision/dirty state, NumPy/Python versions, per-block errors, and explicit
not-run statuses for later stages. The source-file manifest identifies dirty
source bytes as well as committed code. The runner does not issue a performance
pass or present logical byte accounting as measured allocation/peak memory.

The [archived CG08 CPU records](../../benchmarks/results/cg08/README.md) report a
maximum absolute loop-reference error of `3.469446951953614e-18` and identical
equation/input hashes across two generations from the clean implementation
commit. The #151 CUDA records in
[`benchmarks/results/tensor-ad-151`](../../benchmarks/results/tensor-ad-151/README.md)
record JVP/VJP numerical, dot-test, recomputation, plan and device-delta
evidence; they explicitly leave production promotion `not-run`.

Precision-request identity and qualification scope are part of the resolved schedule,
not the source equation hash. Cast AD uses the declared arithmetic linearization
rather than the derivative of bit-level rounding; see the
[precision identity and AD contract](../../.agents/notes/implemented/numerics/2026-09-20-tensor-precision-identity-and-ad.md).
