# Shared Fock construction contract

The internal C++ boundaries in `src/scf/fock_build.hpp` and
`src/scf/fock_provider.hpp` separate a mathematical J/K request from its
resolved execution strategy and prepared integral sources. CPU and CUDA
providers can be selected independently. The additive public `generativeqc/fock.h`
and Python `FockPlan` interfaces expose these choices while the legacy method
descriptors retain their density-fitting defaults.

The CUDA device-pointer provider can prepare a generated pure-Coulomb consumer
for value-only spd sources. It uses the compiler's canonical scatter and bounded
shell streams, with the established exact dddd fallback. The generic source
remains available for K, derivatives, mixed precision, unsupported classes, or
insufficient optional capacity. KS planning charges both owners; warm J calls
keep their density and result on the provider stream. Qualification rationale
is tracked in the [pure-J candidate note](../../.agents/notes/proposed/2026-09-23-generated-pure-j-consumer.md).

Complete generated/native full-range J/K coverage remains automatic. Through-f
value requests use the retained canonical source by default, or the generic
source when optional canonical capacity is unavailable. The Direct-HF bounded
value implementation remains available for explicit internal qualification:
set `CudaDirectJkPlan::bounded_value_opt_in` before enqueueing a request, without
changing `GeneratedExchangePlan::bounded_value_capability`. This is a per-plan
test/benchmark switch, not a public Fock option or an environment override.
`direct_jk_bounded_value_enabled()` is the common admission gate for value
consumers; retaining a bounded derivative lease does not enable bounded values.
Range-separated K retains its canonical/generic route. Both selections preserve
the existing strict-FP64 value mathematics and derivative ownership. The
[bounded value policy note](../../.agents/notes/implemented/performance/2026-10-02-through-f-value-policy.md)
records the measured regression and requirements for future default promotion.

## CUDA MD-J default

Eligible CUDA strict-FP64 exact Coulomb values use the density-contracted
McMurchie–Davidson source by default. Admission requires an s/p/d basis, at least
eight public AOs and sufficient optional resident capacity outside a public
resource ledger. Public `ResourceBudget` plans retain normal J because their
incumbent inventory reserves no optional MD storage, including when the budget
has no explicit cap. This preserves later owners, rebuilds and force storage.
Geometry transforms
are prepared on the owning stream; replay contracts the total density into
Hermite coefficients and projects the Coulomb potential back to public AOs.
Normal generated/canonical K, XC, SCF and finalization owners are unchanged.

The public-AO Schwarz mask remains authoritative. Uniformly accepted shell
quartets use the Hermite contraction, while partially screened quartets retain
per-orientation AO eligibility in bounded source pages. Nonsymmetric and UKS
densities include both input orientations. Additional density screening shares
`min(screening_tolerance, 1e-12)` across the complete shell-pair census for each
output element; K never consumes these density envelopes. Screening zero retains
the unscreened contraction except for exactly zero density work.

Optional descriptors, transforms and scratch are charged within a 128-MiB cap
after retained normal owners. Unsupported angular momentum, small systems,
insufficient optional capacity or optional allocation failure retain normal J.
Mixed J, fixed-mask response and derivative requests bypass MD execution.
Derivative-capable owners may retain the metadata for their zero-order requests.
`direct_schedule` reports admission as `md-j-hermite/retained-k`, not a claim
that every request uses that route.

`GENERATIVEQC_DISABLE_MD_J=1` restores normal J at plan creation for diagnostics;
no enable flag is needed for the default. `GENERATIVEQC_MD_J_COUNTS=1` reports
native execution and geometry-candidate censuses when the owner is released.
Candidate counts are upper bounds on probes, not executed primitive products.

`benchmarks/md_j_normal_cold.py` requires three alternating pairs of fresh
processes, identical native library/input/device identities, actual native
96-atom/768-AO grid counts, independent energy and physical-residual gates, and
MD calls matching complete Fock counts. It explicitly removes the disable flag
for default samples. Run all GPU qualification through finite Slurm allocation;
kernel timings and incomplete cohorts do not qualify a cold advantage.
See the [default decision](../../.agents/notes/implemented/performance/2026-10-08-md-j-default-cold.md)
for error-budget rationale, measured evidence and rejected residual schedules.

## Bounded indexed force schedule

Derivative-capable generated exchange owners use the per-system descending
Schwarz pair order by default. `GENERATIVEQC_BOUNDED_SCHWARZ_SCHEDULE=0` (or
`none`) explicitly restores the triangular schedule for debugging and paired
benchmarking; `1`, `indexed`, and `auto` select the default indexed route.
Invalid nonempty values fail closed to the triangular route. Preparation reuses
the existing geometry-bound readback; no density-dependent index is retained.
Independent full-range J/K force sources use an exclusive prefix over
geometry-live block rows, with 16 independently claimed 64-candidate pages per
admitted block product. Density, exact shell and AO screening and physical
quartet orientation are unchanged. Other consumers retain triangular traversal,
although consumers sharing an indexed derivative owner see its sorted pair order.

The optional device prefix costs `(pair_blocks + 1) * sizeof(uint64_t)` within
the owner's existing budget. Insufficient prefix capacity retains sorted
triangular traversal; inability to admit the owner retains the existing generic
fallback. Sorting and paging reduce candidate amplification and improve load
balance, not the dense worst-case scaling. Complete same-binary qualification
showed warm wins from 3 through 96 atoms; the retained moved-geometry timing
negative remains documented and is not erased by this default promotion. See
the [schedule decision](../../.agents/notes/implemented/performance/2026-10-03-schwarz-indexed-independent-force-domain.md).

`GENERATIVEQC_BOUNDED_ANGULAR_FORCE=1` (or `angular`) separately opts full-range
J/K and omega=0.3 LR force sources into thirteen total-angular-order passes.
It is **off by default** and changes neither the recurrence nor the screening
gates. Full-range passes retain the selected indexed/triangular domain; LR keeps
its existing triangular domain. Cursor/output storage is reused on the owning
stream, while shell enumeration is repeated per order. The purpose is to qualify
the tradeoff between compiled kernel resources and repeated scanning, not to
assume less integral work. The switch is recorded in resource and checkpoint
identity; differing or missing historical policy needs explicit warm admission.
The retained diagnostic has negative endpoint evidence and is not a promotion
candidate; see the [rejected experiment](../../.agents/notes/rejected/2026-10-04-tzvpd-angular-force-schedule.md).

`GENERATIVEQC_DIRECT_COULOMB_REACHABLE=1` (or `reachable`) is a separate,
**off-by-default** Cartesian-source experiment. The compiler passes each AO
component's summed axis powers to the shared Coulomb recurrence, which evaluates
only the exact dependency closure of the consumer's roots. Full/LR moments,
screening, primitive counts and reserved auxiliary storage are unchanged. The
policy is frozen when the native J/K provider is prepared and is included in
resource/checkpoint identity. The public-AO fallback and specialized low-order
workers retain their existing evaluation. Host arithmetic checks do not qualify
CUDA execution or performance; see the [recurrence experiment](../../.agents/notes/proposed/2026-10-04-reachable-coulomb-states.md).

The recurrence control also accepts `values` or `forces` to qualify either
consumer independently; `1`, `reachable` and `all` select both. This selection
is frozen with each source owner. It does not adapt to molecule size or current
SCF iteration.

`GENERATIVEQC_DIRECT_HERMITE_CONVOLUTION=values`, `forces`, or `all` (`1`)
separately selects experimental pair-axis coefficient convolution in generic
strict-FP64 Cartesian contractions of total order five or higher. This replaces
the six pair-index loops with three axis convolutions and a three-axis root
contraction. It retains radial moments, primitive/AO admission and the original
Coulomb workspace; floating-point accumulation order changes. Specialized
low-order/all-center consumers, mixed precision and public-AO fallback keep
their existing contraction. The switch defaults off and participates in
resource/checkpoint identity. It establishes no automatic policy or performance
claim; see the [reassociation experiment](../../.agents/notes/proposed/2026-10-04-hermite-axis-convolution.md).

## Public prepared API

`FockPlan` owns normalized geometry, orbital/auxiliary data and native sources.
Create a new plan when those inputs or mathematical coefficients change:

```python
from generativeqc import FockBuildSpec, FockPlan
from generativeqc_compiler.dft import NativeAO

atoms = [("H", (0, 0, -0.7)), ("H", (0, 0, 0.7))]  # Bohr
spec = FockBuildSpec.hf(coulomb="density_fitted", exchange="exact")
with NativeAO(atoms, basis="sto-3g") as basis:
    with FockPlan(basis, spec, device="cpu") as plan:
        result = plan.solve()
        replay = plan.solve(initial_density=result.density, compute_forces=False)
        fixed = plan.evaluate(result.density, derivative=True)
        diagnostics = plan.diagnostics
```

`solve` uses the shared SCF iteration/finalization driver for the declared J/K
energy. It includes no XC. Its forces are complete negative geometric energy
derivatives in Hartree/Bohr, including one-electron, nuclear and Pulay terms.
The optional warm density must satisfy the existing overlap-metric occupation,
Hermiticity and electron/spin trace checks; it is never silently normalized.
Every solve starts fresh DIIS history. Sources persist across replay, and a
failed solve cannot replace another result or retain a failed iterate.
`compute_forces=False` skips response execution and works on either value-only
or derivative-capable plans. The latter retain their already prepared response
data. Use `FockBuildSpec.hf(derivative_order=0)` to avoid preparing that data.

`evaluate` returns unscaled J/K, Fock matrices including Hcore, one- and
two-electron energies and nuclear repulsion. Its optional `gradient` is only
the fixed-density **two-electron** geometric derivative, not a complete force.
Restricted inputs have shape `[AO,AO]`; unrestricted inputs have shape
`[2,AO,AO]`. Returned NumPy arrays own immutable storage. Input densities are
snapshotted once for native execution and result identity.

The plan's mathematical `identity` includes the normalized basis, effective
auxiliary basis, canonical terms, derivative capability, screening, DF metric
cutoff and FP64 precision. Unused auxiliary and absent-term metadata are
canonicalized away. `execution_identity` additionally records the requested
specification, native source hash, backend/device, source mappings and buffer
policy. Result identity includes both identities and the evaluated density;
SCF identity also includes seed, convergence controls and output selection.
These identities do not use or extend the legacy HF checkpoint format.
Both result classes retain detached `diagnostics` after plan closure; the
property returns a copy so caller edits cannot change recorded provenance.

`diagnostics` distinguishes the resolver's preferred standard-HF schedule from
the actual independent plan's source schedule. On CUDA, the public plan uses
CUDA integral/J/K/response consumers with host DIIS. Plans containing a fitted
term borrow the existing prepared ordinary device eigensolver for setup,
iterations and finalization; exact-only plans keep reference eigensolves. Standard
`Calculator` HF continues to use the established fused CUDA solvers. CUDA
device-byte diagnostics cover explicit source buffers and exclude modules,
driver/library-private storage and recurrence stacks.

The C API offers the same ownership and output rules through
`generativeqc_fock_plan_create`, `evaluate`, `solve`, `diagnostic`, `last_error` and
`destroy`. Context and system handles may be destroyed after creation.
Descriptors are versioned and caller-owned output buffers must be disjoint.
Publication is transactional, including SCF nonconvergence. C callers must
serialize calls and destruction; Python serializes them with a per-plan lock.

## Primary CPU HF eigen routing and failures

Ordinary primary CPU RHF/UHF with standard complete exact J/K or complete
DF J/K automatically uses the shared scalar cyclic-Jacobi adapter for iterative
and final physical-Fock eigensolves. This is the route selected by
`run_cpu_fock_strategy`, including the primary NUM01 accuracy and SOL01 proposal
bridges; it is not an opt-in mode or a public/environment provider selector.
Primary density and state getters return this solve's actual state.

Overlap orthogonalization, core guesses, seed checks, preliminary-HF generation,
DFT, custom/mixed/range-separated Fock specifications, and detached physical-HF
reference generation retain their existing eigen routes. The independent
prepared `FockPlan.solve()` entry does not install the primary scalar callback.
Fresh CPU RHF/UHF density-oracle exports use the named internal
`run_cpu_reference_fock_strategy` entry, preserving reference iteration and
finalization without requesting a physical-reference export. CUDA provider
callbacks are unchanged.

The target adapter explicitly selects the scalar, one-thread shared tensor
provider. Its absolute off-diagonal stopping cap is `1e-14` with at most 100
cyclic sweeps. This stopping rule is not an error certificate: the original
F/S eigenframe must also pass the existing `1e-8` absolute residual and metric
checks and `1e-12` scaled residual check. Sweep exhaustion or frame rejection
raises a numerical failure; the adapter does not switch to the independent
reference solver. Invalid dimensions/nonfinite inputs and size overflow retain
explicit exceptions. Allocation failures propagate from the adapter.

This local failure contract does not disable the existing ordinary Fleet
warm-to-cold retry, which can retry an allocation failure as well as a numerical
failure. Every retry retains the selected primary eigen route. Existing resource
admission and caps are unchanged; bounded numeric workspace is not a complete
process-memory or endpoint-wide no-retry guarantee.

## Fixed-density semilocal consumer

`FixedDensityMeanField` combines a native unit-Coulomb, absent-exchange request
with the existing `FixedDensityXC` integrator:

```python
from generativeqc import FixedDensityMeanField, FockBuildSpec, FockTerm
from generativeqc_compiler.xc import FixedDensityXC, functional

spec = FockBuildSpec(
    derivative_order=0, coulomb=FockTerm(), exchange=FockTerm(present=False)
)
with NativeAO(atoms) as basis, FockPlan(basis, spec) as plan:
    consumer = FixedDensityMeanField(plan, FixedDensityXC(functional("PBE")))
    combined = consumer.integrate(grid, density)
```

Here `grid` is a compatible molecular grid and `density` uses the plan's spin
layout. The result contains full fixed-density energy (including nuclear
repulsion) and Fock matrix. Both consumers use one owned density snapshot;
the J/K contraction is implemented only in the native provider. LDA and PBE
are checked against the independent pinned XC integration fixtures and
density-direction energy variations. This is not DFT SCF and supplies no
geometric XC forces; those remain with #162/#165.

### Executable MethodIR exact exchange

The fixed-density consumer now also accepts an explicitly compiled MethodIR plan.
compile_fixed_density_method lowers one SemilocalXCPrimitive plus an optional
full-range ExactExchangePrimitive to the existing FockBuildSpec boundary. It
does not inspect the method identifier and does not own another J/K
implementation. The selected exact or density-fitted providers therefore remain
the common FockPlan sources.

The MethodIR exact-exchange fraction is a physical exchange fraction rather
than the raw-K coefficient used by FockBuildSpec. With the public density
conventions the lowering is cK = -a_x/2 for restricted total density and
cK = -a_x for unrestricted spin densities. PBE0 therefore requests -1/8 K for
RKS and -1/4 K for UKS. FockPlan uses that same coefficient for fixed-density
two-electron energy and Fock assembly, so the executable boundary cannot apply
different hybrid weights to those observables.

FixedDensityMethodPlan records the semantic MethodIR identity, reference/spin,
provider choices and energy/Fock capability. FixedDensityMeanField.from_method
requires an already prepared FockPlan to match that request before evaluation
and attaches both method and executable-plan provenance to its result. Existing
direct FixedDensityMeanField construction retains the historical unit-J,
absent-K semilocal contract and identity.

The same full-range exchange primitive now also drives native **CPU** PBE0
RKS/UKS SCF and the common stationary first-gradient diagnostic. The KS v2
composition suffix carries separate semilocal exchange/correlation scales and
the resolved raw-K coefficient; PBE0 therefore executes through the ordinary
PBE point model plus the common J/K provider rather than through a named-method
scientific branch. The stationary plan adds a same-spin
`D[a,c] D[b,d]` exact-exchange source for each ordered `(ab|cd)` derivative.
CPU hybrid snapshots retain those coefficients so the derivative consumer
cannot reinterpret PBE0 as pure PBE.

Public Python CUDA global-hybrid forces compose this same stationary exchange
source with the actual semilocal point program. B3LYP uses its audited
B88/LYP/VWN-RPA composition, and admitted split meta-GGAs reuse their generated
point programs and tau pullbacks. Eligibility follows primitive coverage and
the native SCF composition contract. See the
[stationary CUDA consumer](stationary_cuda_diagnostic.md) for supported execution
conditions and [hybrid acceptance gates](../maintainer/hybrid_cuda_acceptance.md)
for independent complete-endpoint qualification.

Full-range Direct CUDA total-force execution defaults to precontracting the signed J/K
cotangents together before evaluating the compiler-owned weighted derivative.
Set `GENERATIVEQC_DIRECT_FORCE_REDUCTION=separate` for independent source
contraction or `combined` for the default layout. Both layouts use the same
shell-class, resident-bra and bounded fallback scheduler, precision and screening.
The combined stationary diagnostic publishes `two_electron` in place of the
independent `coulomb` and `exact_exchange` components; it still includes the
one-electron, overlap Pulay, nuclear and moving-grid contributions.

Snapshot v1 and explicit J'/K' exports retain separate source identities. The
optional private integral-gradient v2 bridge returns three channels
`[one_electron, overlap_pulay, two_electron]` for combined full-range execution.
If that bridge is unavailable, the stationary consumer retries the complete
v1 owner within the same budget. Range-separated, fitted and ECP consumers
retain their own derivative contracts. The `direct_jk_force` CUDA component
trace records total two-electron derivative time and its actual output-channel
count; measure complete endpoint wall time with tracing disabled.

## Densities, operators, and coefficients

`FockBuildSpec` version 1 records spin, requested derivative order, and
independent Coulomb and exchange terms. Each term records presence, a signed
Fock coefficient, the full-/short-/long-range operator and range parameter,
and the exact or density-fitted approximation.

All raw matrices are FP64, row-major, in the caller's public AO representation.
The exact CPU consumer accepts nonsymmetric finite density matrices without
silently symmetrizing them. ERIs use chemists' `(ij|kl)` ordering:

- `J_ij = sum_kl D_total,kl (ij|kl)`.
- `K_spin,ij = sum_kl D_spin,kl (ik|jl)`.
- Restricted density includes double occupation: `F = H + J[D] - 0.5 K[D]`.
- Unrestricted densities have unit occupation:
  `F_alpha = H + J[D_alpha+D_beta] - K[D_alpha]`, and similarly for beta.

`build_exact_direct_jk`, `CpuFockPlanView::build`, and `CudaFockPlanView::build`
return unscaled J/K matrices.
`assemble_fock` applies the requested coefficients exactly once. An absent
term has no raw output allocation. Presence and a zero coefficient are
different requests: a present zero-coefficient term still requests its raw
matrix.

`contract_fock_energy` and `CpuFockPlanView::energy_derivative` use the same
resolved terms and coefficients for energy and fixed-density derivatives:

```text
RHF: dE_2e = 0.5 D : (c_J dJ + c_K dK)
UHF: dE_2e = 0.5 c_J D_total : dJ
             + 0.5 c_K (D_alpha : dK_alpha + D_beta : dK_beta)
```

One-electron, overlap/Pulay, and nuclear-repulsion derivatives remain outside
this two-electron consumer. The force is the negative total derivative.

## Resolution and supported execution

`resolve_fock_build` preflights the complete request before any contraction.
Unsupported versions, spin layouts, operators, derivative orders, or provider
combinations fail explicitly. Merely having an enum value does not make that
operator executable.

| Consumer | Executable scope |
| --- | --- |
| Exact CPU raw J/K | Full range, RHF/UHF density conventions, independently present J/K, arbitrary finite coefficients, values and first derivatives |
| CPU DF raw J/K | Full range, both spin conventions, independently present J/K and finite coefficients |
| Shared CPU SCF solver | All exact/DF pairings, independent terms and coefficients, matching first derivatives |
| CUDA fused direct HF | Complete standard RHF/UHF pair and first derivatives; existing fused kernels, device storage, streams, and graphs |
| CUDA DF raw services | Independently selected J/K, resident/streamed/tiled/batch/item/device-pointer execution |
| CUDA direct raw services | Independent terms, public Cartesian/spherical AOs through f, nonsymmetric densities, batch/item execution and matching first derivatives |
| CUDA DF SCF adapter | Existing standard HF DF pair, using existing DF implementations |
| Independent CUDA SCF | Any exact/DF/absent pair and signed coefficients; host DIIS with CUDA integrals, J/K and two-electron derivatives; fitted plans use ordinary device eigensolves |
| SR/LR operators | Rejected; #166 supplies these additional mathematical operators |

The CPU reference consumes already materialized four-center integral and
derivative tensors. This refactor does not make that algorithm bounded or
on-demand. CUDA keeps its existing persistent, quartet, and bounded execution
paths; independent mathematical terms do not require separate GPU launches.

`FockProviderCapabilities` is derived from the registered executable provider for
the requested backend/approximation. CPU-only builds therefore report CUDA
providers as unavailable instead of repeating the compiled-CUDA capability table.
The registry carries execution identity/version, build availability, prepared/resource
requirements and fallback classification; the Fock-owned typed domain still owns
spin, operator, derivative and approximation semantics. `resolve_fock_build` may
represent a mathematically valid backend that is not built, but `PreparedFockPlan`
rejects that provider before numerical source allocation rather than silently
substituting another backend. The generated DF response requires symmetric densities
and preflights this before either provider executes; raw matrices still accept
nonsymmetric densities. Capability registration does not replace system/basis
preflight or probe whether a compiled CUDA provider has a usable physical device.
Existing basis limits and backend initialization still apply.

## Prepared state and compatibility

A prepared HF calculation resolves its request before execution and retains
it in `ScfOptions::resolved_fock_build`. CPU iteration, final-density rebuilds,
and analytic two-electron forces consume the same immutable resolved value.
CUDA direct bucket compatibility also includes this value.

`CpuFockProviderView` borrows a prepared exact or fitted integral owner.
`CpuFockPlanView` binds one source to J and one to K, verifies both providers
before executing either, and invokes a shared source once for a complete pair.
The views never own or mutate a geometry cache. Their immutable owners must
outlive them; changing geometry or the AO/auxiliary representation requires new
bindings. CPU and CUDA plan views instantiate the same `BasicFockPlanView`,
so source selection, absent-term handling, preflight and shared-source dispatch
are implemented once. `CudaFockProviderView` borrows one batch item in an
existing direct or fitted CUDA plan, together with the immutable DF geometry
and response metadata. Item calls preserve neighboring source and scratch
state. DF value and response cutoffs must agree with the resolved request.
The quadratic response retains the full Frechet derivative of the truncated
metric inverse, including retained/discarded-space mixing.

`PreparedFockPlan` owns these views and their existing integral/source data.
The execution registry is not a cache key substitute: concrete provider ownership
and exact source identity remain part of reuse validation. See the
[provider-registration decision](../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-09-18-provider-registration-boundary.md).
It supplies one-electron data to the shared host SCF consumer as well as raw
J/K and fixed-density two-electron response to other consumers. Independent
CUDA single/fleet execution retains one owner per item. Exact compatibility
compares normalized atom/coordinate, shell/primitive, representation, charge,
spin and auxiliary snapshots; resolved semantics, device, buffer allowance
and relevant generated-kernel variants are also checked. No hash collision or
recycled object address can validate a source. A complete replacement is built
before swapping the cache. Convergence thresholds and warm density do not
invalidate integrals. CPU SCF keeps its existing transient integral lifetime
so retaining every reference ERI tensor does not change fleet memory policy.

The mathematical request (`spec`) is distinct from backend/schedule fields.
Screening, precision, and the DF metric cutoff are explicit resolved fields;
an unused exact-provider metric cutoff is canonicalized away. Zero screening
retains the existing unscreened reference semantics used by post-HF exports. Geometry,
orbital basis, auxiliary basis, and device-resource ownership remain in the
enclosing existing prepared plans and their compatibility checks.

The old DF selector still first chooses the DF approximation, then selects
its backend. `AUTO` does not authorize changing exact into DF or DF into exact.
`run_fock_strategy` centralizes single-item dispatch. Legacy CPU entry points
delegate to the common CPU solver, while existing standard CUDA HF schedules
remain fused. The `CudaIndependent` schedule explicitly identifies its host
SCF control; it does not imply a fused device iteration. Its exact provider
reuses the existing contracted-ERI evaluator without retaining a molecular ERI
or derivative tensor. Its fitted provider reuses the generated external-weight
response, including signed coefficients and the complete metric response.
Source-backed DF plans regenerate bounded tiles; resident/host-streamed DF
plans use the same typed binding. CPU ragged fleets accept explicit resolved independent requests
and retain per-item failure isolation and warm-state ownership.

## COSX provider identity

The internal strategy schema can represent `SeminumericalCosx` as a distinct
exchange approximation. COSX is not an exact/DF schedule variant: its
`FockTermSpec` carries a versioned `FockCosxSpec` containing the complete
quadrature prescription (grid version, radial/angular sizes, partition
iterations, coincident-center tolerance and element radii) plus the
symmetrization/fitting/screening choices. Changing any of these fields changes
the mathematical Fock identity.

COSX v1 is currently restricted to full-range exchange, explicit
symmetrization, no overlap fitting, no screening and derivative order zero.
The provider domain therefore advertises exchange but not Coulomb and does not
inherit the direct/DF first-derivative capability. This lets a method resolve
an explicit `RI-J + COSX-K` request without implying that COSX may provide J.

In CUDA builds, `cuda.cosx` is executable through the DFT-owned
`PreparedCosxFockPlan`. That owner constructs the dedicated COSX grid directly
from `FockCosxSpec`, reserves the bounded COSX device storage first, gives the
remaining device budget to an ordinary J-only `PreparedFockPlan`, and returns
the shared `DirectJkMatrices` used by standard Fock/energy assembly. RHF
consumes the spin-summed density; UHF evaluates independent alpha/beta exchange.

The ordinary `PreparedFockPlan` explicitly rejects COSX so its historical
exact-vs-DF branch cannot silently misroute a new approximation. The CPU COSX
implementation remains a correctness oracle rather than an executable provider.
The public C Fock ABI still exposes only exact and density-fitted choices.
The DFT layer additionally owns internal energy-only RHF/UHF controllers over
this prepared provider. They use host DIIS/eigensolves, physical commutator
convergence gates and unextrapolated final Fock rebuilding. Consequently this
promotion supports internal fixed-density and energy-only SCF execution, but
not AUTO selection, public method support, batching, proposal hooks or forces.

See the
[COSX provider-identity decision](../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-09-19-cosx-provider-identity.md),
[prepared-provider decision](../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-09-19-cosx-prepared-provider.md)
and [COSX reference contract](../reference/cosx_reference.md).

## Validation and scope

`generativeqc_fock_build_tests` uses independent pinned two-AO J/K values, distinct
alpha/beta densities, nonsymmetric densities, and non-unit coefficients. It
checks absent terms, derivatives, preflight failures, and resolved identities.
`generativeqc_fock_provider_tests` adds all exact/DF pairings, independently absent
terms, a separate dense DF oracle, central differences through a truncated
metric, molecular SCF/force comparisons, warm replay, changed geometry and
ragged failure isolation. CUDA DF tests cover independent host and resident
device outputs against the same-approximation CPU services. The existing
RHF/UHF, batch, density-fitting, Cartesian, and spherical suites exercise the
standard method endpoints.

`generativeqc_cuda_fock_provider_tests` covers through-f direct matrices, s/p
derivatives, public representations, nonfinite source/result failure, and
independent DF device layouts. `generativeqc_cuda_fock_composition_tests` compares
all exact/DF/absent pairs, both spins, signed responses and separate batch items
against CPU integrals. It checks resident and regenerated DF storage with a
truncated metric, and complete SCF/replay/changed-geometry force endpoints.
The optional `generativeqc_cuda_fock_provider_tests --through-f-response` numerical
tier adds signed d/f UHF responses against the complete CPU derivative tensors
for both public representations and both independently prepared batch items.

`generativeqc_cosx_fock_provider_tests` qualifies the internal fixed-density
RI-J/COSX-K composition for RHF and UHF against independent CPU DF and discrete
COSX oracles. It also checks that the dedicated grid exactly reproduces the
resolved COSX identity, total device usage stays within the admitted budget,
and the legacy exact/DF prepared owner rejects COSX rather than falling through
to its DF branch.

`generativeqc_cosx_scf_tests` covers cold RHF/UHF convergence, warm replay,
strict warm determinant validation, nonconverged one-iteration state behavior
and explicit force rejection. The returned density and energy are re-evaluated
with independent CPU DF-J and discrete COSX-K oracles, including the final
physical commutator residual.

`tests/python/test_fock.py` exercises public independent choices, transactional
failure, identity, source lifetime, SCF/replay/force consistency and semilocal XC
composition. `generativeqc_fock_api_tests` exercises the public C lifecycle after
context/system destruction and is also run with CUDA under the scheduler.
The [retained production comparison](../../benchmarks/results/fock-strategies/README.md)
contains matched, synchronized CPU/CUDA endpoints, raw samples, quantitative
errors and hardware/build provenance. Complete endpoint medians changed by
+0.77% on CPU and +0.28% on CUDA; all energies and raw J/K matrices are
unchanged, with complete force differences below 1e-14 Hartree/bohr.
This is an architecture non-regression study, not a speedup promotion.
No complete DFT SCF method is advertised.

`tools/benchmark_fock_strategies.py` runs one worker per revision/backend
against production Release builds with `GENERATIVEQC_CUDA_FAST_COMPILE=OFF`. It
records fixed-density direct CPU and DF CPU/CUDA matrices, complete RHF/UHF
SCF/forces, warm replay, changed geometry and four-item batch timings, with
all raw samples and matched-approximation numerical gates. The standalone
`benchmarks/fock_dispatch_probe.cpp` compiles against either revision and
compares the old contraction entry with the new provider boundary. Baseline
CUDA has no independent direct raw API, so its standard direct route is

The runner never publishes its artifact directory or changes a production
selector. Accepted evidence is selected through the repository evidence policy
after accuracy and overhead review.
Optional `--case`, `--spin`, `--approximation` and `--endpoint` filters repeat
a selected endpoint with its normal setup/warmup. The retained CPU bundle
includes an alternating-order focused reproducer and the code-layout diagnosis
that led to the local DF function alignment hint. Python plan identities use
native-normalized controls and device indices, including accepted NumPy scalars.

### CUDA DF final-state validation

The shared final-state selector owns the identity checks, absolute/scaled
acceptance gates and bounded physical-Fock correction loop. Its CUDA algebra
provider evaluates eigen residuals, metric orthogonality, density reconstruction,
DSD idempotency, commutator, electron/spin traces, physical energy and requested
canonicality with FP64 device products. Stable norm reductions detect nonfinite
inputs and overflowing products before acceptance. Matching sizes or a prior
converged flag never authorize reuse.

Ordinary finalization consumes the retained C/epsilon and verifies device
solver status and determinant generation against the full source/model/epoch
identity. Frame validation downloads compact diagnostics. Force selection also
downloads the current physical Fock for the existing ordinary eigenprovider and
checks its occupied projector against the requested density tolerance. A failed
probe is reused by bounded correction. Requested physical-reference C and
force-consumer W remain explicit host outputs. After acceptance, the device
forms W as `D F[D] D / spin_weight` using two counted GEMMs and existing scratch.
Reference export reuses the
selector's stronger canonicality diagnostics. The independent CPU reference
validator remains available for imported references and scientific tests.

One lazy workspace per prepared DF plan holds nine matrices, one spectrum and
bounded reduction storage, serialized across items and spins and included in
tile-budget admission. It never borrows graph scratch. CUDA allocation, library
and execution failures propagate without selecting a CPU fallback.

`GENERATIVEQC_DF_REFERENCE_FINAL_VALIDATION=1` explicitly restores the CPU validation,
projection and W path for independent diagnostics and causal timing comparisons.
`GENERATIVEQC_DF_FORCE_FINAL_REBUILD=1` and `GENERATIVEQC_DF_REFERENCE_FINAL_EIGEN=1` still
perform the actual bounded correction/rebuild path. Component traces report
validation/W GPU intervals, transfers, synchronization and workspace bytes;
host regions and the progress journal retain physical-Fock/eigen/correction
counts. These intrusive diagnostics must be run separately from clean endpoint
timing, with independent oracle checks outside the timed call.

The progress journal separates frame reconstruction from physical fixed-point
defects, and reports fixed-point checks, their eigen solves and rejections.
These extra force checks leave energy-only selection unchanged and must be
included in complete endpoint cost.

See the [device-validation decision](../../.agents/notes/implemented/performance/2026-09-16-device-final-validation.md)
for ownership rationale, resource tradeoffs and qualification evidence.

`GENERATIVEQC_CANONICAL_RSH_VALUES=shared` (or `1`) is a default-off canonical
full J/K plus SR/LR K value experiment. Eligible strict-FP64 Cartesian sources
share density preparation and one canonical traversal; generic orders >=5
also share primitive geometry/Hermite preparation. Radial moments and all
three source outputs remain separate. The extra two-spin Cartesian output
matrix costs `2 * batch * cartesian_aos**2 * sizeof(double)` and is admitted
after existing source/force owners within the same budget. Its absence retains
the separate paths. This does not enable bounded through-f values, change
force consumers, or establish an endpoint speedup.
