# Stationary CUDA RKS gradient diagnostic

`generativeqc._stationary_cuda.complete_rks_cuda_gradient_diagnostic` executes all
`StationaryGradientPlan` sources on CUDA: one-electron, Coulomb, XC AO motion,
XC point motion, XC partition response, overlap/Pulay, and nuclear repulsion.
Full-range global hybrids add an exact-exchange contribution from the same
ordered ERI derivative provider, with MethodIR-owned coefficients and same-spin
`D[a,c] D[b,d]` weights. Source storage and final reduction follow the gradient
plan, including its order and complete source inventory.
The result is an energy gradient in Eh/bohr; force is its negative. The public
Python C2 endpoint reuses this consumer for qualified CUDA LDA/PBE/r2SCAN RKS/UKS
forces, and admitted direct global-hybrid RKS/UKS graphs. All-electron execution
admits Cartesian and real-spherical s/p/d public AOs; scalar ECP execution remains
s/p. Public ECP scope and
resource/work limits are described in [ecp.md](../user/ecp.md#public-cuda-semilocal-ecp-forces).
The native C and CPU DFT force capabilities are unchanged.

The admitted domain is direct, all-electron, real FP64 integer RKS/UKS with canonical
semilocal or global-hybrid compositions, s/p/d public AOs and the native unpruned
version-one grid.
Distinct nuclei and no point/center collisions are required, including at zero
weights. Global hybrids require an explicit grid, device-fused XC, FP64 and
an all-electron Hamiltonian. Their public force capability comes from complete
primitive coverage; native SCF preparation still enforces the admitted point
program and exact composition. Merely resolving a MethodIR does not grant SCF
or derivative execution. Density fitting, range-separated/nonlocal hybrids,
angular momentum above d and Hessians are outside this contract.
Ordinary stationary first derivatives require no CPKS/Hessian solve.

All-electron semilocal public forces retain packaged AOT modules. Composed global-hybrid
forces compile a bounded plan-specific wrapper using NVCC on first use and
reuse it through the ordinary compiler cache and prepared owner. Set `CUDACXX`
or `CUDA_PATH` to the toolkit when it is not discoverable. Primitive derivative
objects are cached independently of functional/spin wrappers. There is no CPU
scientific fallback. The semilocal point graph, work-domain treatment and
exchange fraction are shared with energy evaluation; meta-GGA consumers carry
the tau pullback through the same AO geometry path.
The [global-hybrid force decision](../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-09-26-generic-cuda-global-hybrid-forces.md)
records the composition, ownership and qualification rationale.

JIT stationary consumers also reuse generated primitive and wrapper sources
across processes, before derivative emission or Becke primal/AD reconstruction.
The integral owner keys exact ordered requests, component domain and shard ABI;
the wrapper owner keys the method/point-program provenance, stationary plan,
partition iterations and primitive shard layout. Both include logical generator
dependency hashes, strict FP64 policy and target witnesses. Sources are bounded
UTF-8 data with checked byte counts and SHA256 hashes, published as a complete
atomic directory. Missing entries regenerate; corrupt or partial entries fail
closed. Concurrent publishers verify that their source bytes agree.

This is source reuse, not an alternative binary cache or an AOT qualification:
the existing source/header/toolchain/flag/target/object/binary checks still run.
Small-system integral fallback and mandatory native-integral demand projection
remain unchanged. `GENERATIVEQC_STATIONARY_SOURCE_CACHE=0` disables persistent
source reuse for diagnostics, retaining byte budgets and ordinary binary reuse.
The default is `1`; other values are rejected. Entries live under
`semantic-sources/` in `GENERATIVEQC_STATIONARY_CACHE`. A corrupt entry can be
removed explicitly to regenerate; no damaged source is silently trusted.

Force work records expose `stationary_source_cache`: primitive requests/units,
source bytes, hit/miss, recipe verification, lookup, generation and publication
host spans, and the wrapper's corresponding spans. `binary_cache_seconds` is an
inclusive lookup/compile/link span, **not** compiler subprocess time, and cached
artifact `compile_seconds` is historical build metadata, not current work.
These records describe owner construction; a retained owner's later executions
do not repeat that construction. Complete endpoint timers still include source
preparation. See the
[source-reuse decision](../../.agents/notes/implemented/performance/2026-10-07-stationary-semantic-source-cache.md).

## Execution and ownership

CUDA snapshot wire v3 appends the actual owner's GridSpec, raw atomic measures
and measured snapshot-export D2H/read/synchronization counters. CPU wire v2 is
unchanged. Legacy CUDA v1 snapshots remain readable, but cannot enter this
complete diagnostic. CUDA hybrid wire v8 additionally binds the full semilocal
and exact-exchange composition. Neither Python labels nor copied matrices can manufacture
the live opaque native token. Replay, closure, replacement and rejected updates
revoke the old snapshot; the token is checked again before publication.

The complete route retains these explicit host boundaries:

- Native CUDA SCF constructs its grid and has existing provider setup boundaries.
  The final D/F/C/epsilon export, validation and W construction are explicit host
  operations. The derivative function consumes that exported snapshot.
- Python consumes a versioned identity-bearing bounded task-source contract
  (`to_payload().schema + identity + logical_size + pages(capacity)`). The identity
  must equal the canonical hash of the versioned payload, and every page must bind
  that same identity plus contiguous ordinal/offset metadata. A screened source may
  explicitly publish `logical_size=0`, in which case it must yield no pages and is
  recorded as `empty`. The current producer enumerates
  ordered AO pairs/quartets through `RuntimeTaskDomain`; a compact shell-task
  producer can replace it without changing the executor. Non-component-expanded
  s/p paths fill each page of task descriptors in
  one vectorized operation rather than one Python call per AO tuple; spherical
  component expansion retains the scalar fallback. Primitive expansion remains
  native. Python does not evaluate a derivative or reduce scientific contributions.
- `plan_cuda`/`compile_cuda`/`PreparedCuda` execute source weights and the final
  complete-source reduction. Their inputs and small outputs stage through the host.
- Existing `CudaGrid` evaluates AO jets and density features. The geometry
  consumer borrows AO jets, D-contracted jets, features and the producer stream
  during the locked task lease; those arrays never download for differentiation.
- Generated integral graphs, the existing SCF point model
  `semilocal-scaled-v1/pbe-spin-c2-1e-18`, generated AO bilinear pullbacks and the
  shared CPU/CUDA Becke adjoint execute on device. No interior diagnostic XC
  model, CPU derivative/contraction or interpreter fallback is selected.

For admitted phased Becke geometry, a bulk producer evaluates the same SCF
point model or consumes borrowed external seeds once per point, using one
thread per point. The cooperative AO
consumer then specializes away both that evaluator and the unused inline Becke
adjoint. It borrows the already allocated inline scratch for the point value
and external grid-motion seeds, ordered on the grid producer's stream; no new
resident allocation or host staging is needed. Admission requires one geometry
lane per point and enough atom-channel scratch to keep those values disjoint.
Nonphased geometry and small scratch domains retain the original evaluator,
while an AO panel that does not fit shared memory retains the ordered scalar AO
consumer. The panel reducer visits AO labels once, preserving each atom's and
the moving grid's original AO addition order even for repeated or unordered maps.
Native preflight and stage launch gates preserve sticky CUDA status without
adding a stream synchronization or letting a consumer read a failed producer's
scratch.

Native code owns traversal, primitive normalization, atom scatter and bounded
reductions. The Becke worker shares one two-pass implementation across backends,
including the single-zero-factor derivative and saturated-branch policy.
Primitive CPU emitted bytes are preserved. Device compilation disables FMA
contraction; no broad fast-math flag or relaxed acceptance threshold is used.

## Stationary AOT packaging

All-electron public force requests select packaged AOT by the actual stationary
plan, point-program code and spin, including represented global hybrids. A shared
point code is not sufficient: PBE and PBE0 have distinct plans, and changing an
exchange coefficient does not reuse a standard hybrid artifact. An unrepresented
composition retains the explicit bounded JIT path. Once a catalog profile is
selected, a missing, corrupt or incompatible package fails closed; it does not
silently discover NVCC or regenerate primitives, wrappers or AD.

The build compiles the method-independent s/p derivative inventory once, and the
component-expanded s/p/d inventory once as 23 bounded shards. Each selected
method/spin profile contributes only its specialized wrapper and a device link
for each domain. XC expressions and exact scientific contraction weights remain
specialized; this is not a giant dynamically branching all-functional kernel.
The derivative task ABI and small-system integral fallback are unchanged. Shared
objects reduce compilation work, but each linked library still includes its
primitive code; no corresponding package-size reduction is implied.

`GENERATIVEQC_STATIONARY_AOT_PROFILES` is a deterministic semicolon-separated
CMake build/package inventory. The default preserves the compiler's existing
qualified profile catalog. For example,
`-DGENERATIVEQC_STATIONARY_AOT_PROFILES='pbe0_rks;pbe0_uks'` packages only those
profiles in both s/p and s/p/d forms; an empty value emits no stationary CUDA AOT
inventory. Unknown names fail configuration, and duplicates/order do not produce
extra targets. This setting is not scientific admission, and omitting a profile
does not authorize silent runtime compilation of a normally packaged request.
Changes to the hashed compiler/asset contract invalidate prior manifests; the
manifest writer verifies both halves of a separable s/p source before recording
the combined source identity and linked-binary checksum.
Integral-weight graph hashes are generated offline into the manifest. Cold
loading checks the complete method/TensorIR compiler-source closure rather than
regenerating AD; endpoint source coverage is validated without constructing a
new reduction program. Runtime work records reuse the admitted weight hashes.
The manifest writer seals the complete build record, including these graph
hashes, source/compiler/plan identities, binary checksum, primitive domain and
target/precision fields, with a versioned canonical integrity checksum. Loading
rejects a missing or inconsistent seal before returning an artifact, without
regenerating IR/AD. This detects record corruption under the trusted-build
model; it is not an authenticity signature. The changed compiler contract and
required seal deliberately invalidate older unsealed manifests without changing
the CUDA ABI or generated scientific source.
Use repeated `--profile` arguments to `tools/audit_stationary_aot_package.py`
when auditing a deliberately restricted package; both domains remain mandatory
for each declared profile, so missing files cannot silently reduce the audit.

The explicit hardware gate is `tests/python/test_stationary_aot_cuda.py`.
Set `GENERATIVEQC_STATIONARY_AOT_CUDA_TEST=1` inside a finite Slurm allocation
and select the matching built native library through `GENERATIVEQC_LIBRARY`.
It checks energy/analytic forces, prepared reuse and displacement for both
hybrids/spins with sto-3g (including p shells) and spherical def2-SVP.
The fixtures use neutral bent water for RKS and its singly charged doublet for
UKS. PySCF 2.14.0 / Libxc 7.0.0 is required only as an independent test oracle
outside production execution. Optional `GENERATIVEQC_STATIONARY_AOT_EVIDENCE`
retains endpoint timings, numerical errors, artifact provenance and semantic
work records. This
small-system gate does not substitute for the investigation-scale timing or
catalog/resource qualification campaigns.

## Timeline fixture preparation

The timeline benchmark prepares SCF states with density tolerance `1e-12`,
energy tolerance `1e-12`, and at most 200 iterations. Evidence records these
settings in `provenance.scf_preparation`, including incomplete campaigns.
Energy-only SCF preparation is excluded from the force endpoint; explicit
snapshot export is included. Native snapshot acceptance is unchanged and a
failed export remains a failed campaign, never a hidden retry or force call.
See the [preparation decision](../../.agents/notes/implemented/numerics/2026-09-21-timeline-snapshot-preparation.md).

## Bounded resources and failure

Preparation admits at most 32 atoms, 128 AOs, 4096 points per tile, 4096 task
descriptors per resident/native page, and 128 source-weight terms. The default
`max_primitive_records=16,000,000` is a **per-native-page primitive-work budget**,
not a cap on the total logical force traversal. Any number of individually admitted
pages may contribute to one force execution; cumulative `primitive_records` remains
an exact coverage metric and is checked against the analytically expected total.
Grid points remain capped at 1,000,000 and grid pair visits at 100,000,000.
For `A` atoms, `N` AOs, point capacity `P` and primitive capacity `R`, the new
source arena owns exactly
`8*(22*R + 2*Kp + 4*N + (579+3*S)*A + 3*P + 2*Ns*N*N) + 256`
bytes, where `Kp` is the primitive-table length, `Ns` is the number of density
spin blocks and `S` is the plan-owned source count (seven or eight). The Becke
scratch has 32 atom-sized worker slices; there is no coordinate/grid/AO tensor.
Ordered primitive work is `(1+H)*K**4 + (A+2)*K**2 + A*(A-1)/2`, where
`H=1` when full-range exchange is present and `H=0` otherwise, and `K` sums each
public AO's primitive count once per normalized Cartesian expansion term. Native
submissions are cut adaptively by both descriptor capacity and primitive-work
budget, so a high-primitive basis can shrink a page without changing the compiled
scientific graph or introducing a whole-force work cap. The bounded implementation
currently traverses ERI derivative tasks once per Coulomb/exchange contribution; it
does not claim a fused-J/K speedup. Pair visits are
`(1+2*grid_points)*A*(A-1)/2`.

All TensorIR programs and the grid/source capacities are admitted before device
allocation. Default additional-device and host-numeric bounds are 512 MiB and
256 MiB. The device bound conservatively also charges adapter host capacities.
The caller's existing SCF owner/snapshot, Python object headers, compiler
processes/graphs, mapped code and CUDA context/module/stack overhead remain
explicit exclusions. This is not a global SCF-plus-derivative reservation.

The ordinary diagnostic retains its explicit 256-point default. Passing
`tile_points=None` opts into the same compiler tile search used by the composite
semilocal/nonlocal consumer: try 1024, then 256, 128 and successively smaller
bounded tiles. Every candidate must admit the complete concurrent source,
AO, native-provider, host and submission-window inventory before allocation or
compilation. Explicit integer requests either fit unchanged or fail; no budget
is increased implicitly. The selected size appears in `grid_work_plan`, and
`grid_tile_schedule`/`grid_tile_points_requested` distinguish automatic selection
from explicit capacity. This changes scheduling, not AO screening or the total
point/Becke-pair domain. Larger tiles are not guaranteed to fit or to be faster.

The source arena has one private stream and retains no borrowed grid pointers.
Geometry work finishes on the grid owner's stream before releasing its lease,
including exceptional exits. Device ordinal comes from the actual snapshot and
must match the current CUDA device and borrowed owner. No visibility override is
used. A native failure poisons the source transaction; reads fail until reset.
The public diagnostic discards the owner and publishes no partial result.

`result.work` records exact source launches, cumulative primitive/point/pair counts,
actual native primitive-page count and peak page work; bulk-packed page/descriptor
counts and scalar-fallback descriptor counts identify the Python packing route. The
bounded task-executor metadata separately records producer-page counts so logical
enumeration pages are not confused with descriptor-reservoir flushes,
source H2D/D2H bytes and call counts, explicit source-stream synchronization
counts, snapshot export counters, streams, grid allocation/timing metrics,
TensorIR execution/transfer totals, declared numeric bounds, endpoint time and
the paths/hashes of every loaded generated artifact. `work["timeline"]` is an
exclusive host-wall timeline: its phase durations sum to `endpoint_seconds`
without overlap and without introducing CUDA synchronization. The #662 benchmark
also enables `profile_device=True`: four reusable CUDA events bracket each already
synchronized source batch, so `work["device_phase_ms"]` separates primitive H2D,
derivative kernels, reductions, geometry H2D/kernels/reductions, setup work and
final D2H. Event elapsed times are read only after an existing source synchronization;
no extra synchronization point is inserted. `synchronization_wait_wall` measures
the wall time spent in those existing stream synchronizations and is reported as
attribution, not double-counted into the additive wall timeline. Transfer bytes,
launch counts, TensorIR device timings and grid timings are likewise separate
attribution metrics. The reused grid/TensorIR ABIs still do not expose a complete
endpoint kernel-launch count; source launches
must not be presented as the endpoint total. No speedup is claimed.

## Example and qualification

Run GPU commands through an explicit real-device allocation. Build with the full
qualified CUDA toolkit and select the architecture reported by the allocated
device; for example H100 uses `sm_90`, while RTX 4090 uses `sm_89`.

```python
from pathlib import Path
from generativeqc import Calculator, GridSpec, KsOptions
from generativeqc._dft_gradient import StationaryKsState
from generativeqc._stationary_cuda import complete_rks_cuda_gradient_diagnostic
from generativeqc_compiler.common.cuda_adapter import CudaCompilerAdapter
from generativeqc_compiler.common.cuda_target import cuda_target_info
from generativeqc_compiler.dft import NativeAO

atoms = [("H", (0, 0, -0.7)), ("H", (0, 0, 0.7))]
compiler = CudaCompilerAdapter(
    Path("nvcc"), cuda_target_info("sm_120"), compile_timeout=600
)
calc = Calculator(
    method="pbe-rks",
    device="cuda",
    ks_options=KsOptions(
        grid=GridSpec(radial_points=24, angular_polar=8, angular_azimuth=16)
    ),
    energy_tolerance=1e-12,
    density_tolerance=1e-10,
)
with calc.prepare_batch([atoms]) as batch, NativeAO(atoms) as basis:
    energy = batch.execute(strict=True).items[0].energy
    state = StationaryKsState.from_native(batch, basis)
    result = complete_rks_cuda_gradient_diagnostic(
        state, basis, compiler=compiler, cache=".cache/stationary-cuda"
    )
    forces = -result.gradient
```

From the repository root, using a Python with NumPy, pytest and PySCF:

```sh
python tools/run_stationary_cuda_validation.py
python tools/run_stationary_cuda_validation.py --full-fd -k reconverged
python tools/run_stationary_cuda_validation.py --sanitizer memcheck -k 'analytic or source_failure'
python tools/run_stationary_cuda_validation.py --sanitizer initcheck -k 'analytic or source_failure'
python tools/run_stationary_cuda_validation.py --cpu-regression

# Issue #662: cold/artifact-warm/same-state/changed-geometry evidence.
# Invoke this command inside the allocated Slurm shell used by the project.
python tools/benchmark_stationary_cuda_timeline.py \
  --output build/issue662-stationary-timeline.json
```

The opt-in device suite compares H2 and asymmetric s/p water, LDA and PBE,
against independent PySCF/Libcint/Libxc analytic gradients including full grid
response. Every signed source has a `1e-7` Eh/bohr gate. Multistep reconverged
finite differences (all Cartesian coordinates at three steps with `--full-fd`)
use a `1e-6` raw coordinate gate and `1e-7` extrapolated gate.
Failure tests cover malformed input, byte/work admission, corruption, invalid
device, stale/replaced state, late failure, recovery, empty tiles, exact-zero
products and vacuum tails. CPU scientific/interpreter entrypoints are blocked
during complete CUDA execution. Sanitizer runs are separately invoked/counted.
Evidence is retained locally in ignored `build-cuda/stationary-evidence/`.
The #662 benchmark additionally records three default AO-size fixtures, RKS/UKS,
state-export time and the complete diagnostic timeline in one JSON schema. A
method that is still outside the checked-out branch's CUDA force capability is
retained as an explicit `unsupported` row rather than silently omitted.
`--library`, `--cache` and `--evidence` select explicit local paths; the existing
Slurm profile environment selects partition and GPU request. CPU regression
runs locally without reserving a GPU.

The r2SCAN-3c closure gate in `tests/python/test_r2scan3c_execution.py` adds the
exact spherical H-Ar def2-mTZVPP contract. Its water case exercises the full
s/p/d component domain, checks total force against reconverged directional finite
differences, records bounded semantic work, and checks HF/water ragged
changed-geometry replay against fresh public execution.

The [decision record](../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-09-19-stationary-cuda-diagnostic.md)
preserves shared-science choices, measured evidence and remaining qualification.
The [s/p/d shard decision](../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-09-22-stationary-cuda-spd-derivative-shards.md)
records the multicomponent lowering, compiler boundary and resource caps.

## Restricted PBE0 point schedule

`GENERATIVEQC_STATIONARY_PBE0_RESTRICTED_POINT=off|on` requests the private
restricted geometry-point schedule; its default is `on`, with `off` retaining
the general point route for qualification or diagnosis. It does not change
the SCF policy, precision, functional weights, force assembly or public force
capability, and a request alone does not prove fast-path execution.

The compiler admits only explicitly unpolarized PBE components with exact
semilocal weights 3/4 exchange and 1 correlation. The optional grid v2 getter
lends a generation-bound identical-spin density-and-gradient witness from the
owned density producer. The optional stationary resident-weight enqueue v2
rejects stale generations and unknown flags before geometry work. Selection
also requires precomputed phased storage, sufficient atom scratch and no
external seed. Legacy artifacts, unproven producers and bounded nonphased
plans retain the general point evaluator; the v1 task-view ABI is unchanged.

Clean-source qualification at `99ebd196d`, aligned to master `4444d0376`, is
retained in
[`pbe0-restricted-point-default-20261010`](../../benchmarks/results/pbe0-restricted-point-default-20261010/README.md).
It covers same-binary off versus unset/default complete warm and moved-warm
energy-plus-force endpoints, with actual route/work counts and independent
accuracy gates. It does not qualify cold/reconvergence, later master changes,
UKS/HVP, or resource-complete global performance promotion.

Force-work diagnostics expose `pbe0_restricted_point_capable`,
`restricted_point_requested`, `restricted_point_batches`,
`restricted_point_count`, `general_point_batches` and `general_point_count`.
Batch/point counts describe actual enqueues and are differenced per execution;
capability and request are policy metadata, not semantic work counts. The
specialized point retains the direct AO translation pullback and complete
moving-grid/Becke terms. This private gate does not qualify general PBE, UKS,
response or HVP numerics. The
[producer-binding decision](../../.agents/notes/implemented/performance/2026-10-10-producer-bound-pbe0-force-point.md)
records the rationale and separate scientific/endpoint acceptance boundaries.

## Strict compilation environment

The stationary CUDA compiler rejects nonempty `NVCC_PREPEND_FLAGS` and
`NVCC_APPEND_FLAGS` before generation or cache publication. External flags
cannot silently override the qualified FP64 arithmetic policy. Recording an
override in artifact metadata is not numerical qualification. Use the explicit
compiler adapter for supported target/toolchain selection.

## Scalar ECP diagnostic

CUDA snapshot v5 extends v3 with the live energy owner's exact core counts and
Gaussian ECP records. CPU v4 and all-electron CPU v2 / CUDA v3 layouts remain
unchanged. ECP parameters enter the model identity; replay and closure revoke
the derivative lease. Legacy CUDA snapshots without bound ECP parameters still
reject core-adjusted occupations.

The scalar ECP route uses effective ionic charges for attraction and nuclear
repulsion and adds `ecp_local` / `ecp_nonlocal` to the complete nine-source plan.
The existing generated CUDA ECP provider applies its two-grid convergence gate
and exports both all-center derivative arrays. TensorIR contracts the full
ordered AO pairs with spin-summed density and reduces all nine sources on CUDA.
No CPU ECP derivative or contraction fallback exists. The independent CPU ECP
provider remains available for validation.

This is an explicit dense host export, capped at 16 AOs, 8 atoms, 128 primitives
and 128 ECP terms. The two-grid work admission separately caps the number of
center / unordered-AO-pair / radial-angular samples at 100,000,000 by default
(`max_ecp_pair_samples`). This count is independent of staging batch size and is
reported alongside the ordinary primitive/grid counters. Qualification covers Cartesian s/p LANL2DZ Na / STO-3G H for
LDA/PBE RKS/UKS; these caps do not qualify arbitrary elements or parameter sets.
The provider runs before the other CUDA gradient owners are allocated; its
conservative two-grid workspace is admitted separately. Host bounds include the
re-read final-state snapshot, provider workspace and dense derivative copies.
The ECP workspace and export size are reported separately in `result.work`;
ordinary source launch/primitive counters do not include ECP-provider kernels.
The provider re-reads and validates the native final state, causing an additional
explicit final-state export; this is not an entirely resident force path or a
performance promotion. The public wrapper applies the same work/byte limits.

Run the opt-in numerical gate on an allocated device with `GENERATIVEQC_ECP_CUDA_TEST=1`,
`GENERATIVEQC_ECP_CUDA_TARGET` matching that device (for example `sm_89`), an explicit
`CUDACXX` and current `GENERATIVEQC_LIBRARY`:

```sh
python -m pytest tests/python/test_ecp_stationary_cuda.py -q
```

Diagnostic tests explicitly request `properties=("energy",)` when preparing
snapshots, so the C2 default property set cannot trigger an unrelated public
force calculation. Host-side admission and live-owner wrapper regressions in
`tests/python/test_ecp_cuda_public_boundary.py` run without a CUDA device; they
do not replace this real-device numerical gate.

The gate compares complete gradients with independent PySCF full-grid-response
analytic gradients and three-step reconverged energy differences. It also checks
raw derivatives against the CPU oracle, translation, ionic nuclear charges,
replay/closure/model identity, admission, late failure recovery and all-electron
v3 regression. See the [decision note](../../.agents/notes/implemented/numerics/2026-09-19-cuda-ecp-stationary.md).
