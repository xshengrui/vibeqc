# Canonical RHF-MP2 energy and analytic forces

GenerativeQC exposes real FP64, closed-shell, all-electron conventional canonical RHF-MP2
on CPU and CUDA, plus RI-MP2 on CPU. Conventional four-centre execution provides
total energies and analytic nuclear forces on both backends. CPU RI-MP2 analytic
forces use the same fitted RHF/correlation Hamiltonian, fixed-rank metric branch,
native response solver, and bounded generated DF derivative consumers. CUDA
RI-MP2 currently provides energy only; a CUDA force request fails explicitly
instead of falling back to the host. The separate `ump2` method provides
conventional CPU FP64 energy on validated UHF references, using the same
compiler-owned spin-labelled equation inventory as the bounded UMP2 core.
Neither method includes ROHF-MP2, frozen core, ECP, complex orbitals, screened or approximate
correlation, Hessians, or mixed precision. No performance replacement is implied
by the numerical qualification.

```python
from generativeqc import Calculator

calc = Calculator(
    method="mp2",
    basis="sto-3g",
    device="cuda",
    correlation_memory_budget_bytes=256 * 1024**2,
)
result = calc.singlepoint(
    [("H", (0, 0, -0.7)), ("H", (0, 0, 0.7))],
    properties=("energy", "forces"),
)
print(result.energy)  # total RHF + MP2 correlation, Hartree
print(result.forces)  # Hartree/Bohr; force = -gradient
print(result.correlation)  # OS/SS, reference, denominator, memory and transfers
```

RI-MP2 is selected explicitly. The auxiliary basis is part of the Hamiltonian;
when omitted, the orbital basis is used as the auxiliary basis.

```python
ri = Calculator(
    method="mp2",
    basis="sto-3g",
    device="cpu",
    density_fitting="cpu",
    density_fitting_relative_threshold=1e-10,
)
result = ri.singlepoint(
    [("H", (0, 0, -0.7)), ("H", (0, 0, 0.7))],
    properties=("energy", "forces"),
)
```

CPU RI-MP2 analytic forces complete C2 by composing the native MP2 adjoint and
true-residual RHF response with the shared fixed-rank inverse-square-root VJP and
the bounded #143 raw three-center/metric derivative consumers. No coordinate-major
DF derivative tensor is materialized. CUDA RI-MP2 analytic forces remain unsupported: the public request fails explicitly before force publication and
never returns RHF-only forces or silently delegates the RI response/derivative
chain to the CPU. The C ABI publishes the energy, complete force array, and
correlation/response diagnostic as one transaction; any reference, denominator,
response, derivative, CUDA, nonfinite, or output-buffer failure leaves caller
storage unchanged and invalidates prior diagnostics.

Homogeneous prepared MP2 batches support conventional energy and force
requests. Each item owns its reference, response, provider, diagnostics, and
candidate outputs; immutable method options alone are shared. A failed item
sets only its per-item status and does not overwrite its output storage or
poison successful neighbours or a later replay. Warm-enabled batches retain the
last successful HF density and its source geometry. It seeds a new strict RHF
solve, including after geometry changes; it does not skip reference validation.
A failed/nonconverged seeded solve retries cold. Clear, freeze, and checkpoint
restore use the generic batch controls, and a new seed replaces the old one only
after the complete MP2 endpoint succeeds. MP2 batches explicitly reject HF
profiling flags, all RI batch requests, invalid coordinates, and unknown flags.

## Fixed mathematical contract

References are real FP64, canonical closed-shell RHF with every electron
correlated, occupied spatial columns first, 2/0 occupation, and a nonempty
virtual space. The existing all-electron Cartesian/real-spherical basis
support through f is used. Input geometries are Bohr; energies and orbital
energies are Hartree, gradients and forces are Hartree/Bohr, and
`force = -gradient`. Conventional reference and correlation use unscreened
exact Coulomb integrals. RI reference and correlation use the same auxiliary
basis, metric cutoff and fitted Coulomb Hamiltonian. MP2's default screening
is explicitly zero; a nonzero request fails rather than changing its
Hamiltonian.

For all **ordered** spatial indices i,j occupied and a,b virtual:

```text
g[i,j,a,b] = (ia|jb)                      chemists' ERIs
x[i,j,a,b] = (ib|ja)
D[i,j,a,b] = eps_i + eps_j - eps_a - eps_b < 0
E_OS       = sum g*g/D
E_SS       = sum g*(g-x)/D                alpha-alpha plus beta-beta
E_corr     = E_OS + E_SS = sum g*(2*g-x)/D
E_total    = E_RHF + E_corr
```

There is no further half/quarter factor in the restricted ordered-domain
formula. The independent spin-orbital oracle uses `1/4 |<IJ||AB>|²/D` and splits
occupied spin labels explicitly. Restricted amplitudes have simultaneous
`ijab↔jiba` symmetry, not independent occupied/virtual antisymmetry.

For RI-MP2, raw three-center integrals `A[mu,nu,P] = (mu nu|P)` and the
auxiliary Coulomb metric `M[P,Q] = (P|Q)` define
`B[mu,nu,Q] = sum_P A[mu,nu,P] M^(-1/2)[P,Q]`. Eigenvalues at or below
`density_fitting_relative_threshold * lambda_max(M)` are removed. The fitted
integral used in the same ordered MP2 equation is
`(ia|jb)_RI = sum_Q B[i,a,Q] B[j,b,Q]`.

Direct MO slots `(i,a,j,b)` and exchange slots `(i,b,j,a)` are separate provider
requests. Exchange is reordered into the same local ijab coordinates. Each
occupied axis has extent one; virtual extents use 1/2/4/8. Final virtual tiles
use zero coefficient columns and a valid virtual energy, so padding contributes
zero without introducing a zero denominator. The correlation consumer never
allocates complete molecular T2 or AO ERIs. CPU RHF preparation uses dense AO
ERIs with a checked capacity; CUDA RHF uses the bounded matrix-direct route.

## Native path and placement

### Dense Native Orbital Oracle Admission

`canonical_orbital_rhs` and `canonical_lagrangian_weights` in
`src/posthf/mp2_gradient.hpp` retain the explicit dense legacy/oracle
representation, not the production streamed force path. They check a hard
12-orbital cap before inspecting numeric inputs or allocating Fock/weight
vectors. This matches the small complete-gradient integral oracle's 12-AO
ceiling. They apply a default 1 MiB upper budget for newly owned numeric payload.
`canonical_orbital_rhs_with_budget` and
`canonical_lagrangian_weights_with_budget` accept a tighter explicit byte
budget without changing the existing entry-point symbols or result layout.
Insufficient bytes or an oversized oracle throws `std::length_error`; no
streamed, CPU-reference or other scientific fallback is substituted.

For `N` orbitals, `O` occupied orbitals and `V = N - O`, the allocation-free
`dense_orbital_rhs_plan` and `dense_lagrangian_weights_plan` report:

| Native oracle | Returned numeric bytes | Simultaneously owned peak bytes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Orbital RHS | `8*(N^4 + N^2 + 2*O*V)` | `8*(N^4 + 4*N^2 + O*V)` |
| Relaxed weights | `8*(N^4 + 2*N^2)` | `8*(N^4 + 4*N^2 + 2*O*V)` |

The RHS peak includes old/new rotation gradients during reassignment. The
relaxed peak includes both still-retained orbital-RHS vectors while the
rotation gradient, overlap and stationarity scratch coexist. Exact-budget
acceptance is inclusive. Caller-owned h/ERI/adjoint/Z inputs, object headers,
allocator rounding and exception storage are outside this owned-payload
scope; these plans are not complete endpoint/RSS admission. The size cap is
also necessary because bounding bytes alone does not bound dense rotation
work. Production streamed limits remain independently planned and unchanged.

`tests/python/test_mp2_dense_oracle_budget.py` compiles the actual native
translation units, checks scoped requested-payload lifetimes, tests exact and
one-byte-short admission, and compares values with an independent NumPy
implementation on synthetic and committed PySCF Hamiltonians. This does not
prove that retaining the dense representation is profitable or that other
shell-stage materializations should be retained.

### Production Execution

```text
C / C++ / Python public prepare
  -> method registry -> Mp2Prepared
  -> existing RHF driver, requested owned physical reference
  -> conventional: CG10 RawSource + cyclic staged MO transforms
  -> RI: shared DF source + metric factor + occupied/virtual three-center transform
  -> CG08 energy equation -> generated native CPU or CG09 CUDA tile program
  -> native compensated scalar fold
  -> bounded MP2 adjoint + true-residual RHF Z-vector
  -> relaxed one-/overlap-/two-electron weights
  -> shell-local CPU or CUDA derivative contraction
  -> transactional energy + force + correlation/response diagnostics
```

Energy-only requests retain the existing correlation path and do not allocate
force state. Conventional force requests keep the physical RHF reference,
provider, adjoint, response workspace, relaxed weights, one shell-local AO
cotangent, derivative staging, and unpublished output candidates inside one
checked endpoint plan. They never materialize a molecular AO rank-four
cotangent, a coordinate derivative tensor, or a response-history tape.

CPU RHF uses the shared prepared Fock plan and iteration/DIIS/eigensolver. Its
values-only dense integral preparation counts both Cartesian representations
and the additional public tensor for spherical bases before allocation. This
limits the CPU reference size under the requested budget. It does not use the old 12-AO
Python exporter, reconstruct a second HF calculation or calculate HF forces.
GPU RHF reference export shares the ordinary exact shell-quartet owner for
d/f bases and for s/p systems beyond the optional 256 MiB ERI-cache domain.
The bounded queue avoids a complete quartet descriptor table and transforms
public density/Fock matrices to/from Cartesian space once per build. Reference
packing and device admission use the same topology policy, including small
spherical d/f bases below the ordinary HF persistent-ERI threshold.
Cache-eligible s/p references retain the optional ERI cache, admitted after
actual eigensolver workspaces, with the existing matrix-direct fallback under
budget/allocation pressure. The optimized quartet path retains its generated/
native shell-class coverage gate. Both routes preserve unscreened FP64 work and
the complete reference numeric budget; this changes no reference Hamiltonian.

The final physical P,F(P),C,epsilon and S/h are exported as an owned reference.
CUDA column-major C is explicitly converted to CG10 row-major C[mu,p]. Native
host validation checks finite arrays, CᵀSC, FC=SCepsilon, canonical Fock,
commutator residual and canonical density drift. GPU computation of Fock,
orbitals and reference energy remains on device; its reference validation and
matrix snapshots are disclosed host staging.

Conventional correlation AO tiles come from the existing **CPU values-only
source**. CUDA mode uploads those tiles, performs all four cyclic transforms
with CG10 cuBLAS, downloads bounded MO tiles, reorders exchange on host, and
uploads them through CG09's host-input ABI.

RI mode builds the RHF reference and correlation integrals from the same
orbital/auxiliary systems and metric threshold. `density_fitting="cpu"` selects
CPU DF even when the calculator device is CUDA. `density_fitting="cuda"`
requires a CUDA context; `"auto"` follows the calculator device. CPU RI energy
supports auxiliary shells through g; the bounded analytic-force derivative
consumer requires s/p/d/f orbital and auxiliary shells. CUDA RI energy supports
through f. The whitened occupied-virtual three-center tensor replaces the
four-center AO/MO transform and is contracted into bounded energy blocks.

For CUDA RI-MP2 correlation, the existing generated DF source and CUDA metric
plan own the public-basis transform, cuSOLVER eigendecomposition, cutoff and
whitening. The metric currently crosses device-to-host at source creation and
host-to-device once for factorization; orbital coefficients are uploaded once.
The AO-to-MO `B[Q,i,a]` transform, fitted-integral direct/exchange products,
denominators and OS/SS reductions then remain on the device, with only the two
final energy scalars downloaded. When the full transformed B fits the numeric
budget it is retained for the whole correlation phase. Otherwise the same path
uses explicit virtual blocks and two resident B block buffers; this may repeat
source rows and reports that work amplification through the CUDA component
trace.

The performance schedule for these paths is compiler-owned.
`generativeqc_compiler.method.mp2_schedule` maps the conventional provider request
capacity to paired direct/exchange jobs that share one AO source traversal and
selects full-resident versus bounded-B CUDA RI-MP2 execution from dimensions and
the declared numeric budget. `tools/generate_mp2_native.py` emits those choices
into `src/posthf/mp2_schedule_generated.hpp`; native post-HF code retains exact provider resource accounting, allocations,
library calls, block traversal and reductions. The scalar RI-MP2 denominator
and OS/SS pair-energy arithmetic is emitted from the same compiler-owned MP2
scientific inventory. The ownership rationale is recorded in
`.agents/notes/implemented/performance/2026-09-21-mp2-compiler-residency-schedule.md`.

Each entire tile equation executes natively on the selected correlation
backend. The molecular loop and scalar fold are native C++, not Python
callbacks. Conventional CUDA MP2 still discloses its bounded MO host staging;
CUDA RI-MP2 reports `mo_host_staging=False` because transformed B does not
round-trip through the host. This is a correlation-phase residency statement,
not a claim that RHF preparation or the complete public endpoint is entirely
device-resident. There is no external quantum-chemistry production backend or
silent energy fallback. Generated plan symbols are uniquely prefixed to coexist
in one native library; all mathematical coefficients come from the same
TensorIR.

## Budgets, lifetimes and failures

`correlation_memory_budget_bytes` is an internal method numeric-capacity budget
composing sequential reference and correlation phases (zero means 256 MiB).
It is not a new global #203 planner, nor a process-RSS or free-VRAM guarantee.
The largest phase capacity is returned. For each warm-enabled batch item, both
the last-good density/source coordinates and any candidate replacement remain
charged throughout reference, correlation, and force execution. Their payload is
subtracted before phase admission and added to capacity diagnostics. Freezing
updates needs only the old seed; clearing seeds removes that reservation.
Insufficient headroom fails without replacing the last-good seed. These are
per-item bounds, not an aggregate batch-residency budget.
Persistent reference/source buffers,
coefficient panels, two transform stages, detached/reordered MO feeds, tensor
arena, validation arithmetic, scalar outputs, library workspaces and retained
provider allowances are charged. Existing CG10 Python and native block plans
share `plan_spec.py` arithmetic; native code does not maintain a divergent
budget formula. Each CUDA transform is destroyed before the next is created.
RI admission also composes retained RHF/DIIS state with the DF source,
metric factorization/whitening and occupied-virtual transformed state. The CPU
oracle counts its raw/public three-center tensors and host B explicitly. The
CUDA correlation plan instead counts the generated source, metric-plan
reservation, coefficient/energy uploads, transformed-row scratch, resident B
block buffer(s), fitted-integral batches and reduction storage. Requests fail
before a phase whose declared numeric capacity exceeds the correlation budget.

CUDA HF uses the existing arena planner; provider handles receive explicit
retained allowances and actual queried solver host/device workspaces are
checked before allocation. Compact topology, reference validation/export and
temporary host matrices are counted conservatively. CUDA context/module/stack,
graph implementation metadata, allocator rounding, Python/C++ object headers
and BLAS host implementation overhead are outside the numeric accounting
scope. Device-wide observations are not treated as portable bounds.

Near-zero, nonnegative or nonfinite denominators fail explicitly, without
clamping/regularization. The default minimum magnitude threshold is `1e-10 Eh`.
Exactly degenerate occupied or virtual subspaces are accepted only when their
same-space MP2 Lagrangian derivative is zero at the same threshold; a
nonstationary degenerate subspace fails explicitly. SCF nonconvergence is
reported as reference failure; there is no fictitious MP2 convergence loop.
Bad reference, nonfinite integral/arithmetic, unsupported property/backend and
insufficient memory do not publish partial results.
Native context error details propagate to Python. Source/reference lifetime
is tied to the prepared system; changed geometry uses a newly prepared system
and cannot reuse an old reference or MO tile.

Force diagnostics append response iterations/restarts, true absolute and
relative residuals, response and derivative workspace bytes,
`planned_endpoint_peak_bytes`, `measured_endpoint_peak_bytes`, force provenance
flags, equation identity, and response-operator identity. `measured_response_workspace_peak_bytes` separately reports the actual
allocator high-water payload of GMRES-owned arrays, including its returned
solution; `response_workspace_allocation_count` counts successful allocations
in that domain. Both are zero for energy-only execution. The response-only
measurement excludes caller-owned inputs, operator-callback buffers, other MP2
stages, and allocator overhead. It must not populate the complete endpoint field.
A zero
`measured_endpoint_peak_bytes` means that endpoint allocation telemetry is
unavailable; it is not a zero-memory observation or a copy of the plan. This
slice currently reports that unavailable sentinel, so the measured-resource
qualification gate remains unsatisfied. Once measured, numeric ownership must
not exceed the simultaneous plan, which in turn must fit the configured numeric
capacity. CUDA transfer counters disclose staging; they are
not a claim that the full endpoint is device-resident. Older C callers receive
the supported struct prefix selected by `struct_size`.

## Qualification evidence and remaining issue scope

Separate tests cover fixed identical-C/ERI OS and SS, explicit spin sums,
permutations and rectangular tiles; native eight-loop AO→MO and independent RI
factor checks; GenerativeQC HF→public conventional/RI MP2 for H2/H2O/LiH/f-shell
fixtures; a 14-AO independent PySCF 2.14.0 conventional system exercising an
eight-plus-four virtual tail; bad states, nonconvergence, nonfinite arithmetic,
metric rank, mixed backend, denominator and budget boundaries; C/Python force
publication, failure and invalidation. Preserve the existing `1e-9 Eh` energy and
`atol=1e-11, rtol=1e-10` controlled component gates. PySCF is a test-only oracle.

The reproducible driver is `tools/validate_mp2_public_force.py`. It creates a
fresh directory, never overwrites prior results, and records exact source,
library, toolchain, hardware, model, response/resource diagnostics, independent
PySCF conventional MP2 analytic gradients, three fully re-solved Cartesian
finite-difference steps, translation/torque, rotational covariance, changed
geometry energy-force identity, batch replay, CPU/CUDA parity, and explicit
failure outcomes. The reviewed compact record is under
`benchmarks/results/issue193-conventional-force-b2/`; complete raw runs remain
in the persistent experiment location named by its manifest.
CPU runs may set `--fd-workers 4` to evaluate the same ordered plus/minus
displacements in isolated spawned processes; no displacement, step, SCF solve,
or acceptance gate is removed. CUDA qualification requires `--fd-workers 1`.

Compilation or a skipped CUDA test is not endpoint qualification. CUDA
evidence additionally includes real-device public single/batch execution and
compute-sanitizer results. Issue #193 B2 covers conventional canonical RHF-MP2
public forces. C2 promotes the already independently validated RI derivative
mathematics to the bounded native/public CPU force endpoint, with ordinary-CI
H2 and water fully re-solved finite-difference checks and distinct fitted
response provenance. CUDA RI-MP2 forces remain an explicit unsupported backend
capability and never return host, HF-only, or placeholder forces.
