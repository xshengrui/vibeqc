# Architecture decisions

## Executable method boundary

RHF and UHF expose CPU/CUDA energies and analytic nuclear forces. The
backend-neutral `LDA_RKS`, `PBE_RKS`, `LDA_UKS`, and `PBE_UKS` registry
rows remain energy-only, while a qualified CPU all-electron s/p/d execution
context promotes analytic forces through the shared stationary-gradient owner.
These all-electron CPU semilocal calculations retain energy-only defaults;
request `properties=("energy", "forces")` explicitly for the bounded force path.
Its existing admission limits include 16 AOs, eight atoms, 128 primitives and
one million grid points, plus the stationary consumer's work and byte budgets.
RKS is closed-shell; UKS uses independent
alpha/beta densities with total-density J and validated integer spin
occupations. LDA uses `GridSpec v1` and versioned unpolarized/polarized tails;
PBE uses exact interior expressions plus explicit versioned production-tail
policies. Small RKS and UKS matched-grid references pass the recorded `1e-8 Eh`
energy gates. Compiler-resolved DFT names such as WB97M-V reuse stable native
DFT carriers rather than adding a method-specific C ABI scientific driver.

## Method execution boundary

The public ABI no longer dispatches scientific functions directly. Its opaque
calculation and batch handles own method-neutral `PreparedCalculation` and
`PreparedBatch` plans created by the method registry:

```text
C / C++ / Python API
  -> method registry and capability metadata
  -> method-family adapter
  -> scientific implementation and backend plan
```

RHF and UHF are implemented by the Hartree-Fock adapter. DFT RKS/UKS
execution shares one prepared adapter. Its compiler-resolved KS descriptor
carries the MethodIR primitives, spin and explicit exchange/nonlocal
contributions; the native method ID selects a stable provider carrier rather
than re-stating the scientific functional. Existing named DFT ABI IDs remain as
compatibility selectors, while new qualified DFT names do not require a new C
enum or a new `public_methods.json` row. PBE-D4 retains its dedicated carrier
because that ID still selects the separately qualified native D4 correction
owner. System validation, SCF option translation, backend selection and retained
execution state remain private to the adapter.

The ABI registry reports method family, executable properties, and batch support.
Unimplemented identifiers remain discoverable without inflating executable
properties. Native DFT carrier metadata remains backend-neutral and conservative.
Python ``method_capabilities()`` reflects that registry view.

``Calculator.capabilities`` is the second, execution-context layer: after the
backend, basis, precision, density-fitting mode, and composed MethodIR endpoint
are fixed, it may expose an independently qualified property that is not a
native C action. ``PreparedBatch.capabilities`` mirrors the same record. Thus
CUDA WB97M-V RKS/UKS can advertise analytic forces through the public Python
calculator while the native carrier manifest remains energy-only. This split is
intentional and regression-tested; it must not be used to infer forces for an
unqualified backend/basis/method combination.

Result publication is method-neutral internally; the
ABI-0 `density_rms` field retains the density-update convergence measure.
The additive `generativeqc_calculation_get_scf_diagnostic` query publishes separate
density-update and physical commutator RMS values after completed LDA/PBE
RKS/UKS solves, including nonconverged runs. Its versioned descriptor leaves
existing result layouts unchanged. Unsupported methods and failed backend
executions report the diagnostic as unavailable.
Force buffers may be omitted for energy-only execution. The output selection
is propagated through the prepared method plan, so HF backends skip derivative
evaluation instead of merely discarding an already computed force array. The
Python equivalent is ``singlepoint(..., properties=("energy",))``. Default
properties come from capability discovery: HF requests energy and forces,
whereas LDA/PBE RKS and UKS request energy only.

SCF options and retained densities live under `scf/`, not `core/`. The core
types describe only systems and runtime state. Internal callers include the
specific `scf/mean_field.hpp` or `scf/cuda_batch.hpp` boundary they consume;
there is no forwarding HF umbrella.

## Derivative policy

Nuclear forces are native analytic derivatives. The current reference engine
uses forward derivative values inside the primitive integral formulas, then
assembles the stationary RHF derivative from derivative integrals, the
energy-weighted density matrix, and nuclear repulsion. This is deliberately
different from differentiating the eigensolver, DIIS, or SCF iteration trace.

The CUDA s-p-d-f path contracts stationary RHF/UHF gradients on the GPU. Its
normal one-electron owner is the generated derivative DAG: overlap, kinetic and
nuclear-attraction primitives are differentiated once by the compiler and
lowered to the shell-warp consumer, which contracts fixed stationary weights
directly into atomic gradients. The independent CPU/libcint validation path
remains structurally separate. A native cooperative warp implementation is
retained only as the explicit `reference` performance exception; it batches
nuclear point-charge centers through shared Hermite/Coulomb work and is no
longer the production scientific owner.

The canonical first-order
`(p s | s s)`
class generates its two reachable Hermite terms in closed form, with the same
scalar expression serving values and three-axis forward derivatives. The
canonical total-order-2 `(d s | s s)`, `(p p | s s)`, and `(p s | p s)`
classes similarly retain only their at most four nonzero pair terms and form
the reachable Coulomb derivatives directly from the first three Boys values.
For forces, the kernel differentiates the pair coefficients and Gaussian
decay explicitly for participating centers, while coordinate derivatives of
the Coulomb term raise the sparse Cartesian derivative state by one. This shares
the primitive quartet's Boys values, pair centers, decay, and prefactor across
all centers without carrying a general forward-derivative scalar through the
recurrence. Total-order-3 force quartets use the same subset/Wick pair
representation with a three-bit derivative state, evaluate each raised
Coulomb derivative once per Cartesian axis, and reconstruct the fourth basis
center from translational invariance. Total-order-4 and total-order-5 force
quartets enumerate all single and disjoint double Wick contractions of their
surviving pair quanta and evaluate the required Cartesian Coulomb derivatives
through orders five and six, respectively. Orders six and above retain the
general three-component forward scalar until their dedicated derivative
recurrences land.
Total-order-3 shell pairs generate their exact 1/2/4/8 terms as subsets of
their angular quanta; quanta sharing one Cartesian axis add the required
Gaussian pair contractions without allocating recurrence arrays. The quartet
then forms its reachable third-order Coulomb derivatives directly from the
first four Boys values. Total-order-4 shell pairs use the same subset
representation with a widened derivative-state encoding. All same-axis
single Wick contractions and the three possible disjoint double contractions
are accumulated into the fixed 16-term bound, and the quartet evaluates the
reachable fourth-order Coulomb derivatives directly from the first five Boys
values. One runtime Cartesian-component path serves both
double values and the three-axis forward scalar, avoiding component-dependent
template divergence within a warp. Real spherical target AOs carry sparse,
geometry-independent Cartesian expansion terms through the same device value
and derivative consumers. Torch/JAX
bindings call the native gradient as a custom backward; they do not define the
scientific implementation.

The CPU oracle first evaluates normalized Cartesian integrals and their forward
derivatives, then applies sparse, geometry-independent real-solid-harmonic
transforms to every AO index. The d/f matrices use the CCA Cartesian order and
PySCF/libcint real-spherical order. Transforming derivative tensors with the
same matrices preserves the analytic-gradient variational relationship. CUDA
spherical execution uses the identical sparse expansions in its device kernels
and never triggers a host fallback.

## ABI stability

All public descriptors begin with `struct_size` and `abi_version`. ABI version
0 is experimental: callers can detect compatibility, but semantic stability is
not promised until a 1.0 release.

## Performance engineering

Performance-sensitive planners must account for scientific work amplification as well as
peak memory. Source-driven reuse, resident-state borrowing, bounded fallbacks, and
performance-qualification requirements are documented in
[`performance_engineering.md`](../maintainer/performance_engineering.md).

## Runtime ownership

Contexts own device selection and runtime resources. Systems and calculations
are opaque handles. Caller-provided output storage remains caller-owned, and
no hidden process-global calculation state is used.

CUDA context initialization retains compute capability, warp size, SM/thread/
block limits, register-file limits, shared-memory limits, and SM count. It also
selects one generated `KernelSet` for that device. Exact measured profiles are
preferred, compatible profiles must opt in explicitly in the manifest, and an
empty portable profile selects the generic CUDA implementation. A schedule
measured for `sm_120` is never selected on another compute capability.

## Code-generation boundaries

The scientific compiler boundary is:

```text
IntegralIR
  -> backend lowering
  -> CudaTargetInfo + CudaScheduleIR
  -> CUDA source emitter
  -> CUDA compiler/resource/device/benchmark adapters
  -> production registry
```

`IntegralIR` owns only shell structure, requested observables, independent
derivative centers, recurrence choice, precision/screening semantics, and
scientific invariants. It contains no warp, block, register, shared-memory,
compiler, or vendor fields. Backend-neutral `TargetInfo`/`TargetScheduleShape`
tests can therefore validate a synthetic subgroup width without importing a
CUDA emitter. CUDA legality, occupancy candidates, and tuning resource gates
receive an explicit `CudaTargetInfo` instead of module constants.

## Fixed-topology basis layout

CUDA plans retain contracted primitives once per physical Gaussian shell.
Ragged `system_shell_offsets`, `shell_ao_offsets`, and
`shell_primitive_offsets` describe the unique shell storage. Canonical ragged
`system_shell_pair_offsets` plus shell-pair system/first/second arrays retain
consumer topology once per fixed plan. Each target AO stores its shell index
and up to three normalized CCA Cartesian expansion terms. This follows
gpuxtb's separation of immutable topology from expanded numerical consumers
and avoids duplicating a primitive contraction for every d/f component.

The internal `inspect_rhf_cuda_basis_layout` diagnostic makes this invariant
testable without allocating a GPU plan. For the validated 18-AO s/d/f case,
four unique primitive records replace 18 component-expanded references, and
the complete device basis-topology payload, including ten shell pairs and 55
unique shell-pair-pair quartets, is 1,016 bytes. Shell angular momenta,
AO/primitive ranges, shell-pair bounds, and ragged per-system quartet offsets
are resident in the fixed plan.

## Fleet execution

`generativeqc_batch` is a persistent, non-reentrant fleet plan. It copies system
topologies during preparation, so caller system handles can be released. Each
execution optionally supplies new ragged coordinates without rebuilding basis
metadata. Compatible systems are bucketed by AO count, occupied count, and
primitive count; item results are restored to input order.

Every item has an independent status, convergence diagnostics, force buffer,
and retained AO density. A failed item leaves its previous warm state intact
and does not stop other systems. Warm densities are symmetrized and rescaled to
the correct electron trace under the new overlap before use; if the warm solve
fails, the item retries from the cold core guess.

Open-shell cold starts apply a deterministic 45-degree rotation between the
minority-spin frontier occupied and virtual core orbitals before constructing
the density. The rotation preserves electron count and orbital orthogonality
but prevents exact molecular symmetry from trapping UHF in a higher-energy
occupation fixed point, as occurs for the sigma-hole state of linear OH. Warm
densities bypass this seed and retain their converged state.

The CPU reference backend uses a bounded native worker group within each
bucket. A CUDA context builds overlap, core-Hamiltonian, ERI, and nuclear terms
on the device, selects a setup-qualified batched eigensolver, retains all SCF
matrix and convergence state on the device, and assembles the analytic force
without a scientific host fallback. The host submits a fixed maximum iteration
chain; an active mask stops converged or failed systems while peers continue.
Python never orchestrates per-system SCF loops.

The current CUDA implementation is complete for the public executable scope
(RHF/UHF with contracted Cartesian or real spherical s-p-d-f shells), but is
not yet a component-unrolled/Rys or DF HF engine. Its SCF loop uses device DIIS
and a device-tail-launched CUDA Graph.
AO matrices up to 16 use the low-overhead serial device Jacobi kernel and sizes
17--32 use cuSOLVER's batched Jacobi provider. Larger matrices use generic FP64
`cusolverDnXsyevBatched` only when overflow-safe documented API checks and an
isolated exact-signature probe both pass. The probe captures on a private
stream, instantiates with `cudaGraphInstantiateFlagDeviceLaunch`, validates a
host replay and device-tail replay, and records stack identity, workspaces,
status codes, residuals, and orthogonality. Provider rejection keeps the
ordinary stream on standard `Xsyevd` and uses the Graph-native solver only
for the captured portion, rather than aborting SCF. CUDA 12.9's documented
32768
dimension bound is distinct from the measured RTX 5090 provider transition:
512 AOs is capture-compatible on that stack, while 513 and 768 AOs remain
ordinary-cuSOLVER-compatible but reject GenerativeQC's stronger iteration-Graph
contract. Their Fock/matrix work stays in reusable Graphs,
while setup, finalization, and the ordinary-stream iteration gap use the
standard single-matrix `Xsyevd` provider one matrix at a time, matching
GPU4PySCF's robust large-matrix strategy.

The diagnostic environment switch
`GENERATIVEQC_GRAPH_EIGENSOLVER_OVERRIDE=graph_native` is deliberately stronger:
it bypasses provider probing and routes both iteration and finalization
eigensolves through the Graph-native implementation, preventing a known
cuSOLVER capture regression from returning through the ordinary-stream path.

The Graph-native path uses one cooperative block per physical or spin state.
For 33--256 AOs, one 256-thread block applies disjoint round-robin rotations as
parallel cyclic sweeps, reducing diagonalization from the maximum-pivot path's
O(n^4) work to O(n^3). Larger matrices retain the unbounded 64-thread
maximum-pivot fallback. Both paths reuse the plan's temporary matrix for
eigenvectors and impose no public AO-count limit.
Each fixed-topology bucket owns and replays one packed arena and Graph, so warm
executions do not recreate streams, provider handles, workspaces, or graph
executables. Analytic forces are decomposed over coordinates and integral
quartets rather than serializing one complete gradient behind each coordinate
thread. The dedicated force paths through total angular order five compute all
center derivatives from one shared set of Gaussian product and Boys values,
then recover omitted centers from translational invariance; orders six and
above retain the general three-component Dual path.
The production one-electron force uses compiler-owned generated S/T/V
derivatives and a generated schedule selected by
`GENERATIVEQC_ONE_ELECTRON_DERIVATIVE_MAPPING` (nucleus-cooperative by default). It
contracts stationary density and energy-weighted-density inputs directly into
atomic gradients without materializing coordinate derivative tensors. The
previous cooperative native force path and provider selector are retired;
independent CPU/libcint/PySCF validation remains separate from CUDA scheduling.
Coulomb auxiliary states are stored in
a four-dimensional simplex (1,820 states through f) rather than a dense 13^4
thread-local array.

The prepared plan separately caches the exact coordinate vector associated
with its geometry-derived arena state. Equal coordinates reuse overlap, core
Hamiltonian, retained small-system ERIs or direct Schwarz bounds, shell-pair
bounds, nuclear repulsion, and the orthogonalizer. Any coordinate difference
uploads positions and rebuilds all of them on the owning stream before SCF.
Density, DIIS, convergence, and force state are never part of this geometry
cache. A homogeneous valid warm-density replay also omits the
core-Hamiltonian eigenguess because the following warm-density normalization
would replace it exactly; mixed warm/cold buckets retain the common cold-guess
path so every cold member remains initialized.

J/K uses two runtime policies selected by fixed AO topology. Buckets through
16 AOs compute ERIs once per geometry and retain them in the bucket arena,
matching the persistent-cache strategy used successfully in GPUxtb. Larger
buckets allocate no N^4 tensor: a device kernel builds O(N^2) Schwarz bounds,
and a fused direct kernel screens and evaluates Coulomb/exchange integrals
inside every SCF Graph iteration. The analytic two-electron force applies the
same pair-symmetric screening decision, preserving its finite-difference
relationship to the screened energy. For s/p/d/f topologies, direct Fock decodes
only canonical shell-pair-pair and AO-pair-pair lower triangles. Each unique
eightfold-symmetric ERI is evaluated once, then its distinct permutations
scatter Coulomb and matching-spin exchange contributions into RHF or UHF Fock
matrices. The force kernel contracts the identical unique integral set and
differentiates only the at most four participating shell centers. A fixed
topology-derived tile multiplicity stripes large d/f AO-quartet groups across
one-warp blocks while retaining O(N^2) numerical storage. Each compact logical
descriptor still covers 256 quartets and expands into eight virtual subtiles,
so the finer execution grain does not multiply fixed-topology metadata. The
one-warp block is important because exact Fock and force recurrences sit near
the per-thread register ceiling: more independent blocks improve latency
hiding without the inactive lanes of a sub-warp block. Empty subtiles exit
after decoding instead of requiring a per-AO-quartet descriptor array. Double
atomics make this fast but not bitwise deterministic: a 50-replay 21-AO test
showed about 1.5e-14 Eh energy span and 1.4e-12 Eh/bohr maximum force span.
The final analytic force is not part of the iterative SCF Graph, so it need
not preserve the Graph's fixed topology-capacity launch dimensions. For total
angular orders zero through five, one device-resident atomic task head feeds a
persistent pool of one-warp blocks. The pool is capped at eight workers per
multiprocessor: this fits the specialized kernels' measured register demand
while dynamically balancing the irregular compacted AO-quartet derivatives.
The host never reads the final active count. Orders six through twelve retain
fixed-capacity grids because their general three-component derivative kernels
already use 254 registers and the additional queue state reduced, rather than
improved, throughput. Task heads are reset on the execution stream immediately
before force assembly, so prepared-plan replay retains no queue state between
calculations.
The ERI force kernel additionally uses translational invariance: derivatives
over all unique basis centers sum to zero, so it evaluates only `N-1` centers
and restores the final center from the negative sum. This halves two-center
and removes one third of three-center derivative work. Total angular orders
zero through six use dedicated all-center derivative formulas; the sparse
order-two through order-six paths evaluate each raised Coulomb state once per
axis and recover their fourth basis center by translation. Orders seven and
above use a
force-only three-component forward scalar, seeding its Cartesian axes together
and returning all three derivatives from one exact shell-class recurrence.
Both paths avoid repeating the
geometry-independent ERI value work for x, y, and z while preserving the same
screening and symmetry domain.

Prepared full-range Direct stationary integral exports partition an admitted
materialized dddd consumer from the generic bounded force queue when the packed
basis proves maximum shell angular momentum two. Order eight then means exactly
dddd: those tasks retain the materialized consumer's fixed 256-lane component
packets, while the complementary queue uses the qualified 128-lane generic
consumer. The pure dddd specialization does not instantiate the unreachable
generic AD workspace; f-containing angular passes retain that fallback. Both
Combined and Separate source layouts keep the same scientific
screening, physical pair orientation and coefficients. The passes reuse output
and cursor storage sequentially on the owning stream, reset the cursor between
passes, and propagate submission/reset failures. Missing caches, optional
recurrence modes, unproved or f-containing bases and nonstandard launch shapes
retain the complete mixed fallback; no extra retained allocation is required.

The explicitly selected angular force schedule rejects another pass's tasks
before exact shell-level scientific screening. Its host-proved maximum shell
angular momentum also bounds the launched orders, without changing recurrence
or screening: s/p/d bases need at most 1/5/9 passes. The unproved sentinel
retains all thirteen supported passes. Generic, unpartitioned queue ownership
does not read angular metadata, and all queue publication/retirement barriers
remain shared by the force and Fock consumers.

The [queue-split decision note](../../.agents/notes/implemented/performance/2026-10-09-direct-force-dddd-queue-split.md)
records qualification evidence and the retained fallback rationale.

Canonical AO-pair arrays remain resident for one-electron triangles and
Schwarz bounds, following gpuxtb's immutable pair-metadata pattern. Their
one-electron force consumer evaluates every pair once, uses translation for
overlap/kinetic center derivatives, and distributes point-charge nuclei across
one worker warp after sharing its attraction Hermite table across both basis
centers. Each Fock
build reduces the current density to shell-pair absolute maxima before task
generation. RHF keeps the full Coulomb magnitude and its one-half exchange
magnitude separately; UHF keeps total-density Coulomb and maximum same-spin
exchange magnitudes. A device pass then compacts only shell quartets whose
shell-level Schwarz product survives both the configured threshold and at
least one of the two Coulomb or four crossed exchange density blocks. This
reduction and compaction are part of the captured SCF Graph. Every converged
system retains `P_n` and its raw `F(P_n)`. Tight accuracy requests reuse that
pair only when the final density step is at most `1e-12` RMS. The normal
`1e-8` density-tolerance endpoint uses a separately validated `2e-9` RMS cap,
whose 384-AO reuse-versus-rebuild force drift remains below `3e-8 Eh/bohr`.
A looser system alone restores `P_{n+1}` and enters the legacy Fock builder.
Multi-system buckets then regenerate only the transformed
direct densities, shell-pair bounds, and compact quartet metadata for all
selected final snapshots. This repairs the shared task list after peers stop
on different device-tail Graph launches without reevaluating J/K for the tight
systems. Final canonicalization, energy, and analytic forces therefore consume
a consistent per-system density/Fock/task-domain tuple.
After force evaluation, reused systems advance to their already accepted
`P_{n+1}` warm states. When an unchanged-geometry warm input exactly matches
the previous successful return, its resident final energy becomes the next
SCF comparison baseline. The original energy and density tolerances still
apply, but an already converged fixed point may finish after one Graph replay
instead of an artificial two-replay minimum. The diagnostic
`GENERATIVEQC_FINAL_FOCK_REBUILD=1` restores the complete rebuild for A/B checks.
Component-unrolled/Rys quartet kernels and finer AO-level task compaction
remain subsequent scheduler work. Direct quartets
always operate on normalized Cartesian source AOs. For a public real-spherical
basis, capture-safe kernels form `D_cart = C^T D_spherical C`, run the same
exact shell-class Fock and force consumers, and restore
`F_spherical = C F_cart C^T`. This keeps DIIS, eigensolves, energies, warm
states, and returned matrices in the public AO representation while removing
repeated sparse spherical term products from the dominant ERI recurrences.

The packed arena and optional cuSOLVER workspace use CUDA's stream-ordered
memory pool. Allocation occurs before Graph capture and release is enqueued on
the owning bucket stream, so plan construction and destruction do not require
legacy device-wide `cudaMalloc`/`cudaFree` synchronization.

UHF reuses the same fixed topology and physical-system active mask while its
matrix arena stores adjacent alpha/beta states. Coulomb kernels consume
`D_alpha + D_beta`; exchange and its derivative consume only the matching spin.
The two spin commutators are concatenated into one DIIS metric per physical
system, so convergence and failure isolation remain molecular rather than
being reported as unrelated spin jobs.
