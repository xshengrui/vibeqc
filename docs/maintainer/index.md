# Maintainer Guide

Maintain scientific correctness, reproducible performance, resource discipline, and repository health. Use the core workflows for recurring work; subsystem qualification documents define specific acceptance contracts.

Keep the distinction clear: the current rules and qualification procedures live here; raw measurements belong under `benchmarks/results/`, and historical investigation or discarded designs belong under `.agents/notes/`.
