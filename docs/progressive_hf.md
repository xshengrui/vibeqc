# Deterministic progressive HF

VibeQC exposes a bounded two-stage Hartree-Fock controller for using a cheaper
HF calculation only as an initial-state proposal for an explicitly requested
target. The controller never treats the source energy, residual, basis or
provider as the target result.

```python
from vibeqc import (
    Calculator,
    ObservableTarget,
    ProgressiveBudget,
    TargetAccuracy,
    TargetProblem,
    make_deterministic_hf_plan,
    run_progressive_hf,
)

atoms = (("H", (0, 0, -0.7)), ("H", (0.1, 0, 0.7)))
accuracy = TargetAccuracy(
    (ObservableTarget("energy", "absolute", "Eh", absolute=1e-8),)
)
source = Calculator(
    basis="sto-3g",
    energy_tolerance=1e-7,
    density_tolerance=1e-6,
    max_iterations=20,
)
target = Calculator(
    basis="def2-svp",
    energy_tolerance=1e-12,
    density_tolerance=1e-10,
    target_accuracy=accuracy,
)

problem = TargetProblem.from_calculator(target, atoms)
plan = make_deterministic_hf_plan(
    problem,
    source,
    target,
    atoms,
    budget=ProgressiveBudget(
        maximum_source_iterations=20,
        maximum_total_iterations=120,
    ),
)
run = run_progressive_hf(plan, source, target, atoms)
print(run.target.energy, run.verification.status)
```

## Immutable target and typed plan

`TargetProblem` snapshots the resolved #173 scientific model, prepared-provider
identity, basis mathematical/source hashes, observable accuracy requirements,
solver tolerances, requested atom count and the final physical-residual gate.
Grid and local-policy identities are explicit fields and must be absent in the
first HF slice. This prevents a later adapter from silently changing those parts
of the target.

`StagePlan` separately records the resolved model, provider, arithmetic policy,
solve tolerance, transfer operation, optional cost estimate, typed #173 error
evidence and allowed successor stages. `DeterministicHFPlan` currently accepts
exactly:

1. an RHF/UHF initialization compatible in geometry, electron count, spin and
   Hamiltonian, followed by #189 metric density projection; and
2. the exact target model/provider with an FP64 final state. `precision="auto"`
   is admitted only when #174 strict refinement is required and later observed.

Different basis or fitted-operator stages are staged warm starts, not a claim of
one continuous homotopy. No orbitals, virtual spaces or correlated amplitudes
are transported by this controller.

## Failure and budget behavior

Stage count, source iterations, total configured iterations, host projection
workspace, optional Fock builds and optional estimated cost have explicit
budgets. A plan whose configured maximum work exceeds its budget is rejected
before execution. Projection and final-verification host work have separate
bounds. Before creating the verification AO/Fock owners, the controller reserves
its dense audit matrices/copies and checks the existing HF provider inventory
against the remaining host capacity. The full HF inventory is a conservative
admission bound for this fixed-density operation; it is not a measured process
or driver-memory peak. An unavailable inventory fails closed. Exhausting either
part returns `budget_exhausted` without starting the verification Fock rebuild.
The audit resource diagnostic records provider, controller and total host bounds.
Failed source work remains in the execution record and total work count.
Diagnostics separately report source/target setup and execution, projection,
final verification and context cleanup, while `total_seconds` covers the complete
endpoint.

A failed source solve or rejected/out-of-budget projection skips the proposal
and executes the unchanged target from its ordinary cold guess. The target stage
is never replaced by a source result. Target failure is returned in
`FinalVerification`; the public runner does not manufacture convergence by
relaxing tolerances.

## Final verification

`FinalVerification` checks the actual resolved target identity, prepared-provider
identity, basis mathematical/source hashes, native success/convergence,
energy/density gates, physical SCF residual, requested energy/force capabilities,
effective final FP64 arithmetic and complete execution budgets. It distinguishes:

A force capability is established only by a finite, real numerical array with
shape exactly `(TargetProblem.atom_count, 3)`. Empty, partial, extra-atom,
complex or nonnumeric arrays fail closed as an omitted requested observable.

Legacy HF results do not export the optional public physical-residual field. The
controller therefore performs one explicit fixed-density rebuild with the exact
target basis, direct/DF operator, screening, metric and arithmetic policy. It
records the Fock execution identity, density/overlap hashes, RMS and maximum
`FDS-SDF`, and fixed-density energy agreement. This audit is included in target
time and counts as one target Fock build; its failure makes target verification
fail closed. It is a state audit, not an observable-error certificate.

- `verified`: exact target gates passed and an independent #173 assessment has
  status `observed_met`;
- `unverified`: the exact target is established, but observable accuracy has no
  independent reference audit;
- `unmet`: a target identity, state, arithmetic, observable or accuracy gate
  failed; and
- `budget_exhausted`: actual work exceeded a bound or a requested work counter
  was unavailable.

`target_established=True` therefore does not imply that an energy or force error
target is certified. A small SCF residual cannot stand in for observable error
evidence. See the [architecture decision](../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-09-22-progressive-hf-target-boundary.md)
for the rationale and adapter boundary.
