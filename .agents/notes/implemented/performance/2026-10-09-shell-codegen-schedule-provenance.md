# Decision: retain shell-class CUDA scheduling trials as historical evidence

Status: implemented (retrospective record of accepted and rejected schedules)
Date: 2026-10-09
Original documentation snapshot: `fb9586569769fccac67bc23411d902e08119024d`

## Problem and decision

The original current-state codegen guide mixed stable compiler/AOT
contracts with repeated class-specific experiments, synthetic resource
tables, historical PR promotion results, and machine-specific Slurm
reproduction commands. These trials are preserved below without
claiming their source-era defaults remain active.

Use the [current codegen guide](../../../../docs/developer/shell_codegen.md)
and [target manifest](../../../../python/generativeqc_compiler/integral/production_shell_classes.json)
for production behavior. At this snapshot, the `sm_120` manifest had
22 rows, including 21 force and
21 Fock consumer declarations.

All source-era language such as 'now', 'promoted', 'remaining',
'default', and old performance ratios below is historical,
not a current capability or end-to-end speedup promise.

## Experimental Rys backend

The compiler also contains a backend-independent Rys/TRR/HRR state IR. It
constructs a topologically ordered, duplicate-free one-dimensional recurrence
program from any catalog shell specification while retaining the existing
component order and translation recovery for center D. For `dddd`, this model
requires five roots, 1296 Cartesian components, 162 requested axis states, and
216 recurrence instructions. This exposes the high-order state surface without
expanding it into the subset/Wick scalar expression DAG.

An experimental CUDA lowering tests the approach on force-only `ppps`. It uses
the same persistent exact-class queue ABI as production, assigns one complete
shell task to each lane, evaluates a three-root interpolation table, and
contracts the explicit recurrence states immediately into nine force
accumulators. The three-root numerical data and interpolation are attributed to
GPU4PySCF/PySCF under Apache-2.0 in the generated source. Independent tests
cover the first six Boys moments, every Cartesian component, all four force
centers, and translation recovery.

The `sm_120` experiment rejects this lowering for production. The RHF and UHF
wrappers compile at 255 registers per thread, a 56-byte stack, 64-byte spill
stores, 64-byte spill loads, and 8528 bytes of shared memory. The 1,110,608-byte
cubin took 4.67 seconds to compile and embeds a 27,024-byte root table. In two
paired RTX 5090 runs, the Rys kernel took 1.315 ms and 1.032 ms versus 0.455 ms
and 0.456 ms for the production component-lane recurrence: a 2.89x and 2.27x
slowdown, respectively. Maximum force disagreement was `1.19e-13`.

Consequently, the `ppps` thread-task production dispatch remains unchanged. No
force endpoint was run for that candidate and no five-root `dddd` CUDA emitter
was added: the simpler three-root case already fails the zero-spill/resource
gate and loses the isolated timing gate by more than twofold. Reaching
high-order production performance requires a materially different cooperative
primitive/root/component mapping, not direct scaling of this thread-task
prototype. The full measurements are in
`benchmarks/results/rtx5090-ac39177-issue-3-rys3-rejection.json`.

`dppp` now exercises that cooperative alternative. One 192-thread block owns
one canonical task, lane zero evaluates the four-root interpolation once per
primitive quartet, and the 162 active component lanes execute the same
runtime-indexed one-dimensional TRR/HRR program. Each axis uses an explicitly
addressed `5x4` table and returns only its base value and three independent
first derivatives; this avoids both a 162-way divergent switch and the
shell-wide scalar state graph. The fourth center is still recovered from
translation after the six-warp force reduction. The fixed four-root table is a
reproducible, Apache-attributed slice extracted from GPU4PySCF.

On CUDA 12.9 `sm_120`, all four RHF/UHF ordinary and persistent wrappers use
168 registers, a 160-byte stack, zero spills, and at most 960 bytes of shared
memory. The checked-in 8192-task, three-primitive isolated gate improved from
218.329 ms to 183.241 ms (`1.191x`) with `8.32e-12` maximum force disagreement.
In the fixed-`dm0`, one-iteration 384-AO endpoint, the `dppp` kernel fell from
167.420 ms to 139.197 ms and the GenerativeQC median moved from 3.327 s to 3.298 s.
The smaller endpoint gain is expected: current profiling places the remaining
GenerativeQC/GPU4PySCF force-kernel gap across many exact shell classes rather than
inside `dppp` alone. The raw evidence is the
[isolated gate](../../../../benchmarks/results/rtx5090-26ef747-dppp-cooperative-rys4-isolated.json),
[384-AO endpoint](../../../../benchmarks/results/rtx5090-26ef747-384ao-dppp-cooperative-rys4.json),
and [kernel summary](../../../../benchmarks/results/rtx5090-26ef747-384ao-dppp-cooperative-rys4-kernel-summary.csv).

The fixed-root component-lane emitter is now generalized across the measured
`dpps`, `dsps`, and `pppp` force classes, while their Fock consumers remain on
the validated value recurrence. Isolated 8192-task gates improved by `1.239x`,
`1.342x`, and `1.040x`, with maximum force disagreements of `6.51e-12`,
`1.13e-11`, and `6.12e-12`, respectively. All generated RHF/UHF ordinary and
persistent kernels remain spill-free on CUDA 12.9 `sm_120`.

The production decision uses the real fixed-`dm0` endpoint rather than the
isolated gate. In the three-class candidate profile, `dpps` fell from 148.233
to 124.349 ms and `dsps` from 139.192 to 129.825 ms, but `pppp` regressed from
99.936 to 102.041 ms. Production therefore promotes only `dpps` and `dsps` and
keeps `pppp` on subset/Wick. The accepted 384-AO median falls from 3.298 to
3.269 s; all three repeats use one SCF iteration on both engines, with maximum
energy and force disagreements of `1.68e-11 Eh` and `3.15e-8 Eh/bohr`. The
remaining endpoint is `0.655x` GPU4PySCF, so this is an incremental force
improvement rather than a claim that the large-system gap is closed. Raw
evidence is retained in the [accepted endpoint](../../../../benchmarks/results/rtx5090-259c256-384ao-dpps-dsps-rys3.json)
and [candidate kernel summary](../../../../benchmarks/results/rtx5090-259c256-384ao-cooperative-rys3-kernel-summary_cuda_gpu_kern_sum.csv).

The force-only density contraction now algebraically collapses the generic
eight-permutation orbit before entering each generated recurrence. Direct SCF
symmetrizes every accepted external or internally generated density, so the
orbit is exactly one Coulomb product and two exchange products, multiplied by
the diagonal and pair-equality orbit factors. This preserves the former
unique-permutation semantics while removing its nested comparison loop from
every Cartesian component. Exhaustive AO-index equality patterns agree with
the old RHF/UHF expressions to roundoff, and the allocated CUDA suites cover
the resulting production kernels. In the 384-AO fixed-`dm0` profile, `ppps`,
`psps`, `dppp`, `dpps`, and `dsps` move from
182.462/141.303/139.335/124.349/129.825 ms to
178.344/140.030/137.922/122.614/127.782 ms. The matching three-repeat endpoint
median is 3.258 s versus the preceding 3.269 s observation, with the same
one-iteration branch and existing energy/force limits. This is a small
instruction-path improvement; it does not close the remaining direct-force
architecture gap.

Issue #41 adds an opt-in final-density PPPS queue profile alongside the shell
class counters. The diagnostic preserves the actual device materialization
order in one compact signature per ket task, so its lane and primitive-warp
efficiencies describe the production queue rather than a topology estimate.
On the 384-AO fixed-`dm0` workload it reproduces all 1,863,242 screened PPPS
shell tasks and reports 18,528 descriptor slots, but only 894 non-empty
descriptors. Those live descriptors are large: the ket-count median/p90/p99 is
2,401/3,010/3,266. Consequently, scalar lane efficiency remains 94.29% at 256
threads and rises only to 97.07% at 128 and 98.42% at 64 threads. The original
average over holes therefore does not demonstrate an underfilled live CTA.

The stronger signal is mixed primitive work. With
`p_t = nprim_bra * nprim_ket`, the measured production ordering has only
25.995% primitive-work warp efficiency. The 1110 and 1011 orientations are
balanced at 923,243 and 939,999 tasks, while primitive-weighted descriptor
tail estimates remain roughly one ideal makespan beyond the mean. This rejects
smaller whole-descriptor CTAs as the primary PPPS remedy and prioritizes
primitive-signature bucketing plus compile-time orientation specialization.
The complete counters, histograms, environment, and active class ledger are
retained in the
[issue #41 queue artifact](../../../../benchmarks/results/rtx5090-0b6a573-issue-41-ppps-queue-profile.json).

The promoted Phase-3 path buckets each fixed-bra queue by the original
`1110`/`1011` orientation and exact ket primitive-pair count. Its two-pass
device histogram/prefix/scatter adds no host synchronization, global worker
head, primitive-loop barrier, or component reduction. It is enabled by
default and can be disabled for same-binary A/B measurements with
`GENERATIVEQC_PPPS_SIGNATURE_BUCKETING=0`.

On the same 384-AO queue, bucketing raises primitive-work warp efficiency from
25.995% to 86.813% while preserving all 1,863,242 tasks and 10,300,330 units
of primitive work. A five-repeat fixed-`dm0` ABBA endpoint comparison changed
the median from 5.289540 s to 5.168806 s, saving 120.733 ms (2.34%). All
samples retained the one-iteration branch; the maximum A/B differences were
`1.36e-12 Eh` for energy and `2.21e-12 Eh/bohr` for force. The same protocol
also improved the 96-AO endpoint by 2.89% and the 192-AO endpoint by 3.39%, so
the preparation pass does not consume the smaller-case 2% regression budget.
The compact raw
timings, queue invariants, gates, and machine metadata are retained in the
[signature-bucketing artifact](../../../../benchmarks/results/rtx5090-0b6a573-issue-41-ppps-signature-bucketing.json).

The generated scalar worker also accepts 32, 64, 128, or 256 threads from the
same binary via `GENERATIVEQC_PPPS_BLOCK_THREADS`; 256 remains the default. With
signature bucketing enabled on both sides, five-repeat whole-descriptor ABBA
comparisons found 128 threads 0.07% slower, 64 threads 0.40% slower, and the
diagnostic 32-thread CTA 1.59% slower than 256. These measured results agree
with the live-descriptor lane-efficiency counters and reject smaller
whole-descriptor CTAs as a production follow-up. The variants do not change
scalar quartet ownership, generated recurrence code, or primitive-loop
synchronization and remain available for reproducible A/B checks.

A device-side chunked-descriptor candidate was also implemented and measured,
then fully reverted under the issue gate. At 256 threads, chunking improved
the endpoint by 13.70 ms. At 128 threads it recovered 28.93 ms relative to the
slower unchunked 128-thread mode, but the decisive interleaved comparison of
the production 256-thread whole descriptor against 128-thread chunks saved
only 20.86 ms (5.178864 s to 5.158004 s). That misses the required 25 ms
standalone promotion threshold. The rejected candidate retained numerical and
iteration parity; its raw samples remain in the signature-bucketing artifact.

The same device histogram/prefix/scatter strategy now covers the scalar
whole-task `psps` and `ppss` force workers. Each exact-class slice is grouped
by the ordered primitive-pair counts `(nprim_pair0, nprim_pair1)` in a 65x65
signature space; counts through 63 are exact and 64 is the overflow bucket.
The two classes share one small 66 KiB metadata allocation but retain separate
histograms and class offsets, so no task queue is duplicated and all other
generated classes keep their existing order. Both paths are enabled by default
and can be disabled independently with `GENERATIVEQC_PSPS_SIGNATURE_BUCKETING=0` and
`GENERATIVEQC_PPSS_SIGNATURE_BUCKETING=0`.

On the 384-AO fixed-`dm0` endpoint, five-repeat ABBA comparisons measured
`psps` at 5.210367 s versus 5.101462 s, saving 108.905 ms (2.13%), and `ppss`
at 5.106538 s versus 5.036536 s, saving 70.002 ms (1.39%). The maximum A/B
differences were respectively `9.09e-13 Eh`/`1.77e-12 Eh/bohr` and
`9.09e-13 Eh`/`1.47e-12 Eh/bohr`; every sample retained the one-iteration
branch. The comparisons are independent and their endpoint savings should not
be added. Raw samples and promotion gates are retained in the
[low-order signature-bucketing artifact](../../../../benchmarks/results/rtx5090-0b6a573-issue-41-low-order-signature-bucketing.json).

The pre-DSPS Phase-0 ledger joins an unprofiled, iteration-matched endpoint
with five Nsight warm replays and the exact final-density shell-class profile.
At 384 AOs, the accepted endpoint is 2.887663 s for GenerativeQC versus 2.139527 s
for GPU4PySCF (`1.350x`). Relative to the issue baseline, the GenerativeQC endpoint
is 293.829 ms lower and the engine gap is 290.173 ms smaller. Maximum energy
and force errors are `1.55e-11 Eh` and `3.15e-8 Eh/bohr`, respectively.

The profiled GenerativeQC host interval is 2886.001 ms per replay. Device kernels
account for 1526.090 ms: 1458.804 ms in two-electron force, 27.542 ms in
one-electron force, 27.447 ms in screening and queue preparation, and 12.297 ms
in the remaining measured components. The remaining 1359.911 ms is explicitly
reported as host/API/synchronization/idle time that cannot be assigned from a
kernel summary. The range contains only the 0.001 ms final-Fock-rebuild
selector; no Fock-build kernel ran because the replay reused the converged
cold-path Fock state.

The largest exact force classes are now `psss` at 137.054 ms, `dsps` at
127.806 ms, `dpps` at 122.625 ms, `ddpp` at 118.595 ms, and `dpdp` at
114.502 ms per replay. `ppps`, `psps`, and `ppss` account for 55.983, 33.695,
and 19.696 ms, respectively. This establishes `dsps` and `dpps` as the next
generalized roots-at-most-three queue/backend targets; the larger `psss` entry
remains on its separate resident-kernel path. The complete joined evidence is
retained in the
[current-head component ledger](../../../../benchmarks/results/rtx5090-0b6a573-issue-41-current-head-component-ledger.json).

### DSPS scalar Rys3 promotion

The PPPS scalar whole-task Rys3 emitter is now generated from the catalog shell
specification rather than a PPPS-only expression. DSPS therefore uses the same
one-task-per-lane mathematical backend with 32 threads, 32 tasks per warp, and
an eight-block-per-SM launch bound. The Fock consumer deliberately retains its
previous component-lane schedule so the production change isolates force
performance.

The isolated DSPS gate improves from 19.122454 ms for component lanes to
6.183466 ms for scalar thread tasks (`3.093x`) with a maximum force difference
of `1.13e-11 Eh/bohr`. The promoted force kernel uses 252 registers, 7,248 B
shared memory, and no stack or local memory. Its production shell-class time
falls from 127.806 ms to 52.621 ms per replay (`2.429x`), saving 75.185 ms.

On the five-repeat, iteration-matched 384-AO endpoint, GenerativeQC falls from
2.887663 s to 2.810138 s while GPU4PySCF measures 2.135372 s. The change saves
77.525 ms end to end; maximum energy and force errors remain `1.64e-11 Eh` and
`3.15e-8 Eh/bohr`. The 96-AO guard regresses by 0.74%, below its 2% limit, and
the 192-AO guard is neutral. The complete measurements and resource decisions
are retained in the
[DSPS scalar Rys3 artifact](../../../../benchmarks/results/rtx5090-176b07d-issue-41-dsps-scalar-rys3.json).

The same generalized emitter can produce DPPS, but that scalar candidate is
not promoted: PTXAS reports 255 registers, an 832 B stack, and 1,768/2,752 B
of spill stores/loads. DPPS therefore needs lower live ranges or a different
execution mapping rather than production timing of a known-spilling kernel.
Primitive-signature sorting was also rejected for DSPS and DPPS because it was
neutral to slower for their cooperative block workers.

### DPPS uniform component warps

The scalar Rys3 generator also exposed why DPPS needs a different execution
mapping: one thread owning all 54 Cartesian components compiled with 255
registers, an 832 B stack, and 1,768/2,752 B of spill stores/loads. DPPS now
reuses the DPPP uniform-warp geometry instead. Each 256-thread block advances
32 quartets; the hardware lane is the task coordinate and eight warps own
disjoint component slices. The existing 64-thread component-lane Fock worker
is retained unchanged.

The isolated force gate improves from 39.521587 ms for component lanes to
7.822773 ms for uniform component warps (`5.052x`) with a `6.51e-12 Eh/bohr`
maximum force difference. Production kernels use 216--218 registers, a 56 B
explicit stack, 36,360 B shared memory, and no spills. On the real 384-AO
profile, DPPS falls from 122.643 ms to 91.341 ms per replay (`1.343x`), saving
31.302 ms.

The five-repeat endpoint correspondingly improves from 2.810138 s to
2.779508 s; GPU4PySCF measures 2.139936 s, leaving a `1.299x` ratio. Maximum
energy and force errors are `1.59e-11 Eh` and `3.15e-8 Eh/bohr`. The 96- and
192-AO checks retain the one-iteration branch and pass the same accuracy gates.
The complete resource and timing evidence is retained in the
[DPPS uniform Rys3 artifact](../../../../benchmarks/results/rtx5090-908bc46-issue-41-dpps-uniform-rys3.json).

### PPPP uniform component warps

PPPP now uses the same 32-task/eight-component-warp force geometry as DPPS.
This supersedes the earlier component-lane Rys3 experiment, which regressed
the production PPPP kernel from 99.936 ms to 102.041 ms and was therefore not
promoted. The new mapping assigns the 81 Cartesian components across eight
uniform hardware warps while preserving the accepted 96-thread Fock worker.

The isolated force gate improves from 63.000351 ms for component-lane Rys3 to
10.214315 ms for uniform component warps (`6.168x`) with a `6.12e-12 Eh/bohr`
maximum force difference. Production kernels use 230--232 registers, an 88 B
explicit stack, 36,360 B shared memory, and no spills. On the real 384-AO
profile, PPPP falls from 99.109 ms to 69.975 ms per replay (`1.416x`), saving
29.134 ms.

The five-repeat endpoint improves from 2.779508 s to 2.751221 s while
GPU4PySCF measures 2.143309 s, leaving a `1.284x` ratio. Maximum energy and
force errors are `1.64e-11 Eh` and `3.15e-8 Eh/bohr`. The 96-AO check regresses
by 0.91%, below the 2% gate, while the 192-AO check improves by 1.31%. Full
evidence is retained in the
[PPPP uniform Rys3 artifact](../../../../benchmarks/results/rtx5090-6a9f20d-issue-41-pppp-uniform-rys3.json).

### Batched DSPP and DPSS Rys3 promotion

DSPP and DPSS were screened together so their independent PTXAS and isolated
force gates could share one production build, endpoint, profile, and pair of
small-system checks. DSPP uses the same 32-task/eight-component-warp Rys3
mapping as DPPS and PPPP while retaining its accepted 64-thread Fock worker.
DPSS uses one complete Rys3 quartet per lane with 32 lanes and an
eight-block-per-SM launch bound. Generalizing the scalar path also exposed and
fixed a cross-shard helper collision: fixed-root symbols are now shell-scoped
rather than hard-coded to PPPS.

The isolated DSPP force gate improves from 47.847149 ms to 8.043763 ms
(`5.948x`), while DPSS improves from 22.699392 ms to 6.103693 ms (`3.719x`).
Both remain within `1.24e-11 Eh/bohr` of their oracles. DSPP compiles with
214--216 registers, a 56 B stack, 36,360 B shared memory, and no spills; DPSS
uses 252 registers, 6,224 B shared memory, no stack, and no spills.

In the three-replay 384-AO profile, DSPP falls from 79.903 ms to 55.288 ms and
DPSS from 71.554 ms to 29.451 ms, jointly saving 66.718 ms. Total two-electron
force device time falls from 1,323.313 ms to 1,256.506 ms. The five-repeat
endpoint correspondingly improves from 2.751221 s to 2.684645 s while
GPU4PySCF measures 2.136467 s, leaving a `1.257x` ratio. Maximum energy and
force errors are `1.55e-11 Eh` and `3.15e-8 Eh/bohr`; the 96- and 192-AO
checks both improve by about 1.6%. Complete evidence is retained in the
[batched DSPP/DPSS Rys3 artifact](../../../../benchmarks/results/rtx5090-31c3cd7-issue-41-dspp-dpss-rys3.json).

### Batched DPDP and DPDS Rys4 promotion

DPDP and DPDS were screened in the same batch so four PTXAS candidates and
three resource-safe isolated candidates could share one production build,
endpoint, profile, and pair of small-system checks. Force and Fock now have
independently selectable schedules: DPDP uses a 352-thread component-lane Rys4
force worker while retaining its 64-thread tiled Fock worker, and DPDS uses 32
tasks across eight uniform component warps while retaining its 128-thread
component-lane Fock worker. This separation also fixed the tiled Fock Coulomb
initialization stride, which must use the Fock block size rather than the
unrelated force block size.

The isolated DPDP force gate improves from 1308.244630 ms to 399.939026 ms
(`3.271x`) with a `7.28e-12 Eh/bohr` maximum force difference. DPDS improves
from 152.188477 ms to 15.383649 ms (`9.893x`) with a
`6.38e-12 Eh/bohr` difference; its component-lane Rys4 alternative reached
109.091446 ms and was not selected. DPDP compiles with 168 registers, a 200 B
stack, 1,312--1,320 B shared memory, and no spills. DPDS uses 254 registers, a
112 B stack, 36,872 B shared memory, and no spills. A DPDP uniform-warp mapping
was rejected before endpoint work because it compiled with 255 registers, a
1,048 B stack, and roughly 6.3/6.7 KiB of helper spill stores/loads.

In the three-replay 384-AO profile, DPDP falls from 114.339 ms to 35.610 ms and
DPDS from 63.136 ms to 23.361 ms, jointly saving 118.505 ms. Total
two-electron force device time falls from 1256.506 ms to 1137.411 ms. The
five-repeat endpoint correspondingly improves from 2.684645 s to 2.565502 s
while GPU4PySCF measures 2.134699 s, leaving a `1.202x` ratio. Maximum energy
and force errors are `1.46e-11 Eh` and `3.15e-8 Eh/bohr`; the 96- and 192-AO
checks improve by 3.50% and 5.15%. Complete evidence is retained in the
[batched DPDP/DPDS Rys4 artifact](../../../../benchmarks/results/rtx5090-dcff605-issue-41-dpdp-dpds-rys4.json).

### Batched DDPP, DDPS, and DDDS Rys4 promotion

The next batch generalized the runtime-indexed Rys component worker from a
`p` to a `d` shell on the second center. A raised first derivative needs the
exact third-order HRR state, so the generator now emits the bounded cubic HRR
formula while retaining the existing addressed TRR table. The larger task is
kept behind a device-call boundary only for second-center `d` shells; this
removed the final 16 B persistent spill from DDPP without changing the earlier
DPPP/DPDP/DPDS code shape.

PTXAS and reduced 2048-task isolated gates screened all three classes before
the shared production build. DDPP selects a 352-thread component-lane worker
and improves from 535.169800 ms to 122.601616 ms (`4.365x`). DDPS selects the
same 32-task/eight-component-warp geometry as DPDS and improves from
45.304180 ms to 8.872075 ms (`5.106x`); its safe component-lane alternative
reached only 40.866753 ms. DDDS selects a 224-thread component-lane worker and
improves from 358.775848 ms to 76.304947 ms (`4.702x`). Maximum isolated force
differences remain below `4.44e-12 Eh/bohr`.

The selected DDPP kernels use at most 168 registers, a 192 B stack,
1,312--1,320 B shared memory, and no spills. DDPS uses 254 registers, a 112 B
stack, 36,872 B shared memory, and no spills. DDDS uses 254 registers, a 192 B
stack, 1,024--1,032 B shared memory, and no spills. Uniform-warp DDPP and DDDS
were rejected before endpoint testing: DDPP generated roughly 9.3/10.0 KiB of
helper spill stores/loads, while DDDS still spilled roughly 0.46/0.60 KiB.

In the three-replay 384-AO profile, DDPP falls from 118.711 ms to 30.322 ms,
DDPS from 47.369 ms to 15.490 ms, and DDDS from 44.560 ms to 11.027 ms. They
jointly save 153.801 ms, while total two-electron force device time falls from
1137.411 ms to 983.954 ms. The five-repeat endpoint improves from 2.565502 s
to 2.411606 s; GPU4PySCF measures 2.144806 s, leaving a `1.124x` ratio.
Maximum energy and force errors are `1.64e-11 Eh` and
`3.15e-8 Eh/bohr`. The 96- and 192-AO checks improve by 13.55% and 7.38%.
Complete evidence is retained in the
[batched DDPP/DDPS/DDDS Rys4 artifact](../../../../benchmarks/results/rtx5090-541acc3-issue-41-ddpp-ddps-ddds-rys4.json).

### 768-AO Fock follow-up for issue #52

The 96-atom/768-AO warm profile is dominated by bounded streaming Fock, so
similar-looking classes are screened as groups but promoted independently. The
accepted changes are DSDS (Rys3, 128-thread subgroup, four tasks per warp,
materialized pair terms) and DPDP (Rys4, 128-thread subgroup, two tasks per
warp, recomputed pair terms with unrolling disabled). DPDP's isolated Fock
timer fell from a five-run median of about 131 ms to 104 ms; DSDS fell from
about 314 ms to roughly 40 ms in the same diagnostic.

The final 768-AO endpoint (five interleaved one-iteration warm replays, loose
`1e-8` SCF tolerances) measures 4.442 s for GenerativeQC versus 3.727 s for
GPU4PySCF. All replays converge in one iteration; the maximum paired errors are
`1.41e-11 Eh` and `1.13e-7 Eh/bohr`. Alternative shared candidates are not
promoted solely from a common lowering shape: DDPP's subgroup variant regressed
its Fock timer, DDDP's higher task count exceeded the 49,152 B static shared
memory limit, and PPPS with four tasks per warp was slower than its eight-task
schedule.

### Measured schedule evidence on `sm_120`

The largest recent end-to-end gain came from optimizing shared recurrence
structure rather than promoting one more exact class. For small Boys arguments,
the runtime and generated CUDA now evaluate only the highest requested order by
power series and recover lower orders by downward recurrence. The committed
192-AO batch-one measurement improved from about 4.49 s to 3.60 s (`1.25x`).
Keeping the Boys implementation in production and benchmark templates means
this algebraic optimization automatically reaches every generated class.

The complete Fock autotune uses 128 synthetic `dpps` tasks with two primitives
per shell. Searching both pair orientations expands the component schedule
space from four to eight variants. Canonical/shared/unrolled value lowering
remains the winner at 0.365 ms versus 0.485 ms for independent per-component
recomputation (`1.33x`), with maximum Fock disagreement `1.39e-17`, at most
138 registers, zero stack, and zero spills. Swapped/shared/unrolled is only
`0.5%` slower at 0.367 ms, while swapping improves the rolled shared variant
from 0.401 ms to 0.369 ms. Both recomputed-Coulomb orientations lose, and both
unrolled variants spill. The measured winner matches the current production
`dpps` schedule, but endpoint promotion remains governed by the separate
real-molecule gate.

The same eight-way search on the generated `dpps` first-gradient consumer
selects swapped/shared/unrolled at 0.604 ms, versus 0.630 ms for the previous
canonical orientation (`1.044x`). It is `2.89x` faster than the independent
per-component gradient oracle, with maximum force disagreement `8.67e-19`,
151 registers, a 40-byte stack, and zero spills. Pair orientation changes only
the contraction loop/materialized pair, not physical center routing, so this
gain required no shell-specific gradient algebra. Because the joint production
row also owns Fock, a real-molecule endpoint gate must decide whether to retain
one compromise schedule or justify consumer-specific schedules.

The first full tiled search covers 24 `dddd` variants: tile 64/128/256,
canonical/swapped contraction order, rolled/unrolled loops, and materialized
versus recomputed pair storage. Materializing a 16-entry order-four pair table
puts 720--1136 bytes in the per-thread stack and makes every original variant
fail; unrolled variants also spill. Recomputing pair terms removes the array
and lowers the accepted production wrappers to an 80-byte stack with zero
spills. Autotuning selects tile 128/shared/unrolled/swapped/recomputed at
5.302 ms, with maximum force disagreement `4.34e-19`, 168 registers, and all
four production wrappers passing. Tile 256 is arithmetically faster in several
variants but spills, demonstrating why tile timing alone is insufficient.

The same search succeeds for the 2160-component `fddd` class. The selected
tile 128/shared/rolled/canonical/recomputed schedule runs in 42.789 ms, has
maximum force disagreement `8.67e-19`, and uses at most 160 registers, an
80-byte stack, and zero spills across all production wrappers. The shared
noinline oracle is a correctness reference rather than a production-speed
baseline; candidate ranking uses fused kernel time, while real-molecule
promotion still requires the endpoint gate.

For 128 synthetic `dpds` tasks with two primitives per shell, the bounded
search produced:

| Schedule | Time | Registers | Stack | Shared | Result |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| component/shared/unrolled | 1.880 ms | 156 | 40 B | 1880 B | winner |
| component/shared/rolled | 1.941 ms | 154 | 40 B | 1880 B | accepted |
| tiled 64/shared/unrolled | 3.503 ms | 162 | 40 B | 1688 B | accepted |
| component/recomputed/unrolled | 4.489 ms | 168 | 40 B | 1216 B | too slow |
| component/recomputed/rolled | 4.159 ms | 163 | 208 B | 1216 B | stack/slow |

The measured winner matches the current production `dpds` policy. Tiling is
correct and resource-safe, but is retained for larger component products where
the non-tiled mapping is impossible.

For 128 synthetic `ddps` tasks with two primitives per shell, the matching
component/shared/unrolled schedule ran in 2.022 ms versus 4.515 ms for the
independent recompute oracle (`2.23x`). With primitive-pair cache reuse it uses
at most 164 registers, a
64-byte stack, 1880 bytes of shared memory, and zero spills. The real-spherical
def2-SVP water-tetramer promotion gate then measured `1.0099x` speedup for
batch one and `1.0078x` for batch four, with maximum energy and force
differences of `1.48e-12 Eh` and `4.01e-13 Eh/bohr`. This positive endpoint
result promoted `ddps` to the `sm_120` production profile.

An active def2-TZVP water profile shows that classes containing at least one
f shell account for `46.6%` of screened primitive work. `fpps` is the largest
single f-shell class at `4.49%`. Its generated component/shared/unrolled
schedule ran in 1.989 ms versus 4.514 ms for the recompute oracle (`2.27x`),
using at most 157 registers, a 64-byte stack, and zero spills. A 15-sample
real-molecule gate measured `1.0022x`, `1.0054x`, and `1.0060x` end-to-end
speedups for batches one, four, and eight. The maximum force difference was
`7.17e-13 Eh/bohr`. `fpps` is therefore the first production f-shell gradient
class selected entirely by the generic IR, emitter, autotuner, and endpoint
gates.

Shell-wide density-weighted CSE now interns all three `psss` component DAGs in
one graph, shares primitive geometry, contracts the density weights before the
recurrence, emits only centers zero through two, and restores center three by
translation. The independent component graphs contain 375 nodes in total;
the weighted graph contains 318.

For 1024 synthetic `psss` tasks with two primitives per shell, ten iterations,
and seven timing samples, autotuning selected a 32-thread packed schedule at
0.539 ms versus 0.932 ms for the independent recompute oracle (`1.73x`). The
kernel uses 208 registers, a 96-byte stack, and zero spills on `sm_120`.

That older component-cloning kernel did not beat the then-committed handwritten
endpoint. On the real-spherical def2-SVP water tetramer after one-pass bucketing,
it produced `0.9933x` speedup for batch one and `0.9952x` for batch four.
Maximum energy and force differences remained below `1.0e-12 Eh` and
`6.4e-13 Eh/bohr`, respectively. That candidate therefore remains rejected;
the later force-only weighted-ERI lowering is a distinct implementation and is
qualified separately under #356.

## Earlier Fock promotion observation

The `dpps` production row enables both `fock` and `force`. Its coefficient-only
Fock worker measured `1.02249x` end-to-end speedup on the real-spherical
def2-SVP S4 water octamer, with maximum energy and force differences of
`1.36e-12 Eh` and `4.58e-12 Eh/bohr`. `ppps` and `dsps` Fock candidates were
rejected by the same endpoint gate, demonstrating that automatic emission does
not imply automatic promotion.

## Earlier task classification and repository integration

Before the incremental `ddps` promotion, the six generated force classes made
the water-tetramer endpoint
`1.065x` faster than the all-handwritten fallback for batch one and `1.089x`
for batch four. Maximum energy and force differences are `8.0e-13 Eh` and
`4.8e-13 Eh/bohr`. The seventh class, `ddps`, independently adds the positive
`1.0099x`/`1.0078x` endpoint improvement reported above. The eighth class,
`fpps`, adds a smaller but repeatable `1.0022x` to `1.0060x` on the f-shell
def2-TZVP workload. These results include bucketing and registry dispatch.

`cuda_rhf.cu` is also under active development in `../qc`. The codegen branch
is synchronized only from committed upstream history; the latest integration
fast-forwarded through `84152e3`, including the generated `dpps` Fock route,
highest-order-only Boys-series evaluation, primitive-pair cache reuse in both
handwritten and generated Fock/force kernels, and resident-bra chunking for the
handwritten `psss` force fallback.
Uncommitted or untracked state in `../qc` is never copied, overwritten, or used
as a merge source. IR, emitters, autotuning, and manifests remain in independent
modules so future upstream merges touch the hot runtime file only when dispatch
behavior actually changes.

## Historical machine-specific 768-AO reproduction commands

The CUDA/Slurm/virtualenv paths below were valid for their original
experiment only. They require a matching source and environment.

To reproduce the current 768-AO class timing without enabling the expensive
descriptor-count compaction, run the focused profile through Slurm:

```bash
srun --partition=main --gres=gpu:5090:1 --nodes=1 --ntasks=1 \
  --time=00:12:00 bash -lc \
  'GENERATIVEQC_LIBRARY=$PWD/build/libgenerativeqc.so.0.1.0 \
   PYTHONPATH=$PWD/python:$PWD \
   python -u benchmarks/issue52_current_fock_profile.py \
   --output build/issue52-current-fock-profile.json \
   2> build/issue52-current-fock-profile.stderr'
```

The script converges once, freezes the resulting density, and then reports
the per-class `gpu_ms`/launch counters for fixed-`dm0` Fock replays. The
native class rows are written to the redirected stderr file. `--fock-classes`
can restrict warm profiling to a comma-separated subset while leaving the cold
convergence on the complete production registry. The optional `--count` switch
is intentionally separate because it routes through descriptor compaction and
can be much slower on the 768-AO topology.

For the cross-engine regression gate, use the same fixed topology with the
interleaved warm replay harness and an explicit upper bound on the
iteration-matched GenerativeQC/GPU4PySCF ratio. The bound is supplied by the
acceptance job rather than inferred from a stale artifact:

```bash
srun --partition=main --gres=gpu:5090:1 --nodes=1 --ntasks=1 \
  --time=00:20:00 bash -lc \
  'export LD_PRELOAD=/group/software/cuda-12.9.1/targets/x86_64-linux/lib/libcublasLt.so.12:/group/software/cuda-12.9.1/targets/x86_64-linux/lib/libcublas.so.12; \
   GENERATIVEQC_LIBRARY=$PWD/build/cuda-release-sm120/libgenerativeqc.so \
   PYTHONPATH=$PWD/python:$PWD/benchmarks:$PWD \
   /home/jzzeng/codes/qc/build/gpu4pyscf-venv/bin/python \
   benchmarks/compare_gpu4pyscf_batch.py \
   --case water-32mer-4s4-def2-svp-spherical --batch 1 --repeats 3 \
   --max-iterations 100 --energy-tolerance 1e-12 \
   --density-tolerance 1e-10 --reference-gradient-tolerance 1e-8 \
   --screening-tolerance 1e-14 \
   --maximum-generativeqc-over-gpu4pyscf 1.30 \
   --output build/issue52-768-regression-gate.json'
```

The command fails on a timeout, non-converged replay, numerical mismatch, or
an iteration-matched warm ratio above the supplied limit; a partial or missing
JSON artifact is never treated as a pass.

## Historical next-step queue (not a current roadmap)

## Remaining work

1. Reduce the remaining generated `psss` endpoint gap or retain the handwritten
   kernel; do not promote the current synthetic winner.
2. Continue profile-driven f-shell promotion with `fsps` and the first tiled
   class; `fddd` now passes synthetic correctness/resource/timing gates, but do
   not infer endpoint value from primitive-work fraction alone.
3. Benchmark tiled d/f candidates on real molecular profiles, not only
   synthetic shell tasks.
4. Profile additional value-only Fock classes through the shared device slices;
   retain endpoint rejection as a normal outcome.
5. Add a tensor-shaped nuclear-derivative result ABI and corresponding CUDA
   lowering before claiming Hessian automation; `IntegralIR` now preserves
   explicit second/higher-order intent and reports this backend boundary.
6. Extend the per-consumer production schedule support only when an endpoint
   workload demonstrates a material Fock/force execution-geometry tradeoff.

## Invariants and revisit when

Require independent numerical oracles, bounded architecture resource
gates, and source-matched complete molecular endpoints before
promoting generated CUDA. When new evidence supersedes a choice, add
a new decision and link it rather than rewriting this snapshot.
