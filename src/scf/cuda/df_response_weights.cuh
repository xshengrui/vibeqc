/** Produce HF A/M response weights entirely on the caller's CUDA stream.
 * Densities are packed row-major in the same order as the host coefficient
 * descriptors. read_values(P, device_output) generates one public AO slice;
 * consume receives transient device weights and must enqueue its read on the
 * same stream before returning. Both callbacks propagate launch failures.
 *
 * The rank-deficient spectral Frechet map includes retained/discarded subspace
 * motion, using the exact eigensystem and cutoff of the forward transform.
 * Owner-verified full rank permits inverse-applied factors before quadratic
 * products when complete buffers or the fitted-panel callback are available.
 * The owner must reject unresolved rank crossings before calling this routine.
 * blas is the plan-owned host-scalar handle already bound to stream. The
 * serial_metric_dot ablation retains the original fixed-order dot kernel.
 * blas_products selects parallel charge GEMV and density GEMM on that same
 * handle. The scalar route retains its original ordering for comparison; both
 * routes form the complete metric reverse map and moving auxiliary response.
 * Return the first CUDA launch error; the caller drains before freeing scratch.
 * A cuBLAS failure throws CudaDfResponseBlasFailure so its allocation status
 * survives cleanup and cannot trigger an unrequested numerical fallback.
 *
 * packed_pairs requires admitted occupied factors. It emits kind=2 panels
 * with folded lower AO pairs: W_ii, W_ij+W_ji for i>j. Kinds 0/1 retain the
 * dense three-center/metric contracts. Optional public auxiliary shell offsets
 * trim packed panels to whole shells when the cap permits; a smaller explicit
 * cap still splits a shell. Offsets and callbacks outlive this synchronous call.
 * packed_block_rows bounds each rectangular AO expansion block (clipped to n);
 * larger blocks trade extra diagonal-block arithmetic for fewer BLAS launches.
 * Optional read_fitted(begin,count,output) supplies inverse-applied dense
 * auxiliary-major panels from an owner-validated resident forward tensor or
 * regenerated raw AO-pair blocks. It uses the same stream and permits strict
 * full-rank response with a smaller owned tile. Its callback may reuse the
 * otherwise dead workspace[2*a*a:4*a*a] metric scratch; bar_M lives separately
 * at workspace[a*a:2*a*a]. Count all repeated projections and raw generation.
 * single_fitted_tensor instead reserves one complete owned A/B tensor and one
 * bounded weight panel: add (a-tile)*n*n elements to the usual workspace size.
 * It applies the inverse in place through disjoint AO-pair batches, generating
 * raw values once. This option requires full rank, no borrow and no read_fitted.
 * streamed_occupied instead describes bridge-owned projected-factor scratch
 * plus owner-validated canonical coefficients. Raw slices feed charges and all
 * spin projections in one pass. Its raw buffer holds one AO matrix, staging
 * holds sum(rank^2)*a, and exchange holds max(max(rank^2)*a,tile*n*n).
 * It requires full rank and excludes borrowed tensors and fitted-panel reads.
 * retained_coulomb is an owner-verified immutable B view for J-only terms.
 * Full-rank BLAS response may contract B with each density once, apply the
 * metric root to those vectors, and emit the existing A/M adjoints directly.
 * It reuses the ordinary charged workspace; other ranks, terms and diagnostic
 * algebra retain their existing explicit bounded paths.
