 * without allocating transformed weight matrices. This layer assumes no HF

/** Accumulate sum(W_S*dS + W_T*dT + W_V*dV) into an existing O(Natom) buffer.
 * Output is the energy gradient, multiplied by output_sign (HF forces use -1).
 * Nuclear repulsion belongs to the independent caller and is never included.
 * The buffer is not cleared; accumulation may follow an existing nuclear term.
 * An optional active mask isolates failed batch items. Schedule 0 owns AO pairs
 * by thread, 1 uses shell-pair/component warp lanes, 2 uses one serial owner per
 * system for deterministic diagnostics, and 3 assigns one AO pair to a warp with
 * lanes owning nuclear centers. Schedule 3 can instead enumerate those AO pairs
 * implicitly when both pair pointers and pair_count are zero, keeping
 * prepared callers independent of an O(NAO^2) pair-index reservation.
 * Integer-corrected triangular decoding preserves one AO pair per warp and
 * requires no shell-pair scan, component serialization or index upload.
 * No derivative tensors, allocation, transfer,
 * or stream synchronization occurs in this launch.
